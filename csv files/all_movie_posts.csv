Predator Badlands is a letdown from start to finish. 6/10,"
It tries to reinvent the franchise with a sensitive young Predator as the hero and an android sidekick preaching about feelings. Instead of suspense or brutality we get a PG13 space adventure that feels more like a Saturday morning cartoon than a Predator movie.

The tone is all over the place. One minute it wants to be emotional and deep, the next minute there is a cute alien pet tagging along like it is Disney merchandise. The Predator is no longer a terrifying hunter. He is basically a misunderstood teenager with trust issues. They stripped away everything that made these creatures menacing and turned them into moral lesson delivery devices.

The writing is painfully predictable and full of cheesy moments. There is actually a scene where the android gives the Predator a motivational speech about being himself while soft music plays. It feels like Lion King but worse. The villain is just an angry Predator dad yelling about honor and bloodlines. No complexity, no subtlety, just noise. The big monster they build up the whole film is killed offscreen by someone else which completely ruins the payoff.

Even the action is boring. Everything is buried under CGI and loud music with zero tension. No grit, no horror, no atmosphere. It is all colorful effects and nothing sticks. It feels weightless. You never feel any danger because the film is too scared to show anything intense.

In the end Predator Badlands tries to be bold but ends up being toothless. It wants to be emotional, epic and family friendly all at once and fails at everything. Instead of a hunt we get a lecture. Instead of fear we get feelings. The Predator did not evolve here. It got domesticated.

**Rotten Tomatoes:** [89%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/predator_badlands)

**Metacritic:** [69 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/predator-badlands/)

Some Reviews:

[NextBestPicture - Giovanni Lago](https://nextbestpicture.com/predator-badlands/) \- 6 / 10

&gt;Trachtenberg's approach this time around gradually builds to a more underwhelming outing, even if his vision finds itself at its most grand. Not every set piece is effective despite some wonderful below-the-line work to help elevate the experience. The inevitable steering towards a more franchise-heavy focus is all but worrisome.

[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/04/predator-badlands-review-elle-fanning) \- 2 / 5

&gt;The sheer pointlessness of everything that happens subtracts the oxygen and even Fanning’s imperishable star quality can’t save it.

[The Hollywood Reporter - Richard Lawson](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/predator-badlands-review-elle-fanning-dan-trachtenberg-1236417477/)

&gt;It’s a perspective shift that mostly works, so thoughtful is the film’s construction. Trachtenberg is generous but also careful with detail; his film remembers what it has previously introduced us to, satisfyingly referencing back to plants and animals passingly encountered an hour prior. *Badlands* is a decidedly B-movie that thoroughly utilizes and enjoys the freedoms allowed when any prestige ambition is eschewed. The film simply wants to be the best version of a zillionth *Predator* installment that it can be. If it has to complicate — and, yes, soften — the branding to do that, so be it. 

[David Ehrlich - IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/predator-badlands-movie-review-1235158691/) \- 'B+'

&gt;The least “Predator”-like moments in this standalone sequel are rooted in Trachtenberg’s love for the property, and all help “Badlands” to make a uniquely compelling argument that “Predator” deserves to be higher on the Hollywood food chain than anyone thought to place it over the last 40 years. By reckoning with the series’ fundamental weakness rather than continuing to pretend that it’s the series’ greatest strength, Trachtenberg has made the brand richer than ever before. No, this isn’t your daddy’s “Predator,” and it *definitely* isn’t *Dek’s* daddy’s “Predator,” but as a wise synthetic once said, “We can be more than what they ask of us.” How rare — and extremely refreshing — to see a big studio movie recognize that the same can be true of itself. 

[IGN - Clint Gage](https://www.ign.com/articles/predator-badlands-review) \- 8 / 10

&gt;Dan Trachtenberg is heading in an interesting direction with this franchise and he gets bonus points for that. The Predator as a mysterious murder monster is getting some of his backstory filled in, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Badlands, in shifting the perspective to a Yautja main character, actually highlights what’s been great about this franchise in its better moments. Dek and Thia are an unexpectedly fun pairing that bring a new energy to the franchise and an altogether different kind of hunt. It might not be pulling the skull and spine out of us and screaming in bloody victory, but it gets close.

[DEADLINE - Damon Wise](https://deadline.com/2025/11/predator-badlands-review-elle-fanning-dimitrius-schuster-koloamatangi-1236606321/)

&gt;Returning director Dan Trachtenberg is clearly in a groove here, and his enthusiasm helps, notably in the film’s impeccable world-building. But the action scenes never seem to galvanize, and somewhere along the line the predator, once a ruthless, unstoppable killing machine, has simply lost its menacing mojo. It all seems a bit, well, *silly* — like a long episode of *Succession* starring John Travolta’s character in *Battlefield Earth*, or the adventures of Eric Trump in space — and that surely can’t bode well for the inevitable next instalment.

[Slash Film - Jeremy Mathai](https://www.slashfilm.com/2016872/predator-badlands-movie-review/) \- 8 / 10

&gt;If there are any negatives to point out, they're mostly a byproduct of blockbuster issues as a whole. The brisk pacing that keeps things moving at a breezy clip also means any semblance of character depth and nuance is either left as subtext or outright explained in exposition, though Trachtenberg still manages to find quiet grace notes for both Dek and Thia (and perhaps others too spoilery to give away here) amid all the carnage. And even as the action rivals anything in the franchise, the much larger sense of scale might have some yearning for the contained, stripped-down joys of ""Prey."" All of those nitpicks pale in comparison to what the filmmakers accomplish here, however. By far the funniest, most heartfelt, and boldest ""Predator"" movie of them all, ""Badlands"" etches its place in franchise history — right alongside the classic that started it all and the three worthy follow-ups that Trachtenberg has delivered so far. Let's hope there are many more to come.

Predator: Badlands discourse in a single image.,"“His character design is shit, but thats the point!”

“The female synthetic is obnoxious, but that’s the point!” 

“Its goofy and often comedic tone is completely inconsistent with the rest of the franchise, but that’s the point!” 

I haven’t seen the movie and never will, but the discourse around it has been painful. Do the shills not realize “yeah its terrible but that’s the point” is a completely idiotic response to criticism? Because all that means is the point itself is terrible…? There is premise and execution, and just because the execution of the premise is achieved doesn’t negate the shittiness of the premise.

Imagine I made a Spider-Man movie where Peter Parker is a child molestor, and then in response to people complaining about how terrible of an idea that is I say “But that’s the point, I wanted you to be uncomfortable and disgusted with Peter! I achieved my goal and therefore you cannot criticize it because that would mean you lack media literacy!” Thats the exact same logic the shills are using.  ",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
First Predator Badlands reactions just dropped,,Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
I really didn’t like Predator Badlands,"So first things first, as a movie it was decent.  It was entertaining and had decent CGI.  

However the fact it was a Predator really killed it for me.  The whole premise of the Predator being a runt and running off to prove himself is fine, I can get behind that to some degree.

The issue comes with the fact they try to be emotional with it, predators aren’t supposed to be like that are they, it feels wrong from the older movies.  Also the ending with the older predator???  He’s meant to be the strongest and the leader and yet he gets packed up by his runt son who’s been hunting for like 2 weeks??  

just doesn’t make sense to me, i feel like it’s a kids movie rather than a predator movie.  The beauty of predator to me was the Gore and suspense and ruthless efficiency.  I just feel like this new movie lacks that and we aren’t gonna get anymore of those. ",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

(RECOMMENDATION) Predator: Badlands really is THAT good.,"Here’s my brief reaction to seeing Badlands for the first time. First off, if you enjoyed Trachtenberg’s Prey movie in 2022 then you might actually like this one more. It’s legitimately the most smartly made film in the franchise yet. It takes a pop culture icon and delivers something entirely fresh never put on theater screens before. 

It almost reminds me of Matt Reeves’s swing at the Planet of the Apes franchise in 2014. The main character is not a human. He does not speak English. But somehow the filmmakers tell a genuinely good story that is relatable to the human in us. 

Being a Star Wars fan who has been routinely let down, Predator Badlands is a rare example of a major science fiction franchise with FILMMAKERS THAT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING.

As far as where I’d rank it among other 2025 films, I think it’s better than Mission Impossible, Fantastic Four, Superman, and even F1. 

Also for you Alien franchise lovers, a certain company plays a **substantial** role in the film.

What Predator: Badlands taught me about TRON: Ares’ release,"Predator Badlands, a Disney property, noticeably lapped TRON: Ares’ opening weekend.

I plan to see it in the next few days but I can’t help but wonder… what did Disney spend all of TRON: Ares’ money on? Badlands’ budget is around 100 million less than Ares’ and it still has fantastic VFX, visuals, a great story from what I’ve heard, and not mention a similar runtime. 

Whether we want to admit it or not, Leto didn’t help with the box office. He was awesome in the movie, but he just can’t be the lead if we want these movies to garner more success. I’m not saying he can’t be involved in a future TRON film.. he just can’t be plastered everywhere, because that turned a lot of people off unfortunately, a lot more than I imagined. I hear a lot about displeasure towards Disney these days but Predator IP seems to be doing absolutely fine. 

TRON’s fourth movie undoubtedly needs a new approach. I’d love the current story in TRON to be completed within the next few so we can get from this franchise.. and I think Disney may need to take an out of Predator: Badlands book.",Plot/Story/Interpretation/Analysis

"In Predator: Badlands (2025), Kwei has the skull of an unknown therapod dinosaur on his trophy wall. As Dinosaurs went extinct millions of years before he was born, it must be a fossil that he collected, implying that the Predators in The Predator (2015) succeded in giving the Yautja race autism","This was the funniest explanation, but here are other serious ones so nobody calls me a filthy casual:

1: The trophies could be inherited/gifted/stolen from other Yautja, as the race itself is likely far older than the Dinosaurs, and they do pass trophies on to worthy opponents as seen in Predator 2 (1990).

2: The tribe in Predators (2010) had their own planet set up specifically as a game preserve, so it’s entirely possible the Yautja abducted prehistoric species from earth and set them loose on other game preserve planets, allowing them to survive earth’s several extinction events.

3: The Warlord Predator in Predator: Killer of Killers (2025) keeps any creatures who have killed other Yautja in cryosleep, as they are prized opponents, and can unfreeze them after thousands of years for gladitorial combat. Even if the specific motivation to put a dinosaur in cryosleep doesn’t exist in the Yautja’s culture, the technology does.

4: Weylend Yutanni managed to print whole facehuggers from a single Xenomorph in Alien: Romulus (2024) and the United Systems Military managed to entirely recreate Ellen Ripley and a queen facehugger from mere blood samples in Alien: Resurrection (1997). It’s not impossible that a company in the Alien+Predator universe managed to bring dinosaurs back Jurassic Park style, no extraterrestrial assistance required. 

5: They can pull a Monsterverse and retcon that obvious skull into a stupid bullshit ai generated monster whose skull just so happens to perfectly resemble an Earth dinosaur. Did you know the giant Triceratops-like skull in Kong: Skull Island was actually from a giant pinecone? This was the real shitty detail all along.

Could this be a moment where the Alien vs Predator films are completely thrown away, and this is the new real beginning of both the franchise’s collaboration? 

I know that the Alien series doesn’t consider AvP canon, while Predator does, but I could see this as a point where even Predator decides to ignore those movies so that they can create a cohesive story between both franchises. ",Plot/Story/Interpretation/Analysis
A case for Dek’s design in Badlands: Predator maturation and hairline development.,"A lot of the criticism about Dek, particularly his hair or “dreadlock” placement, feels like an overreaction from an exhausting part of the fandom. While everyone is entitled to their own personal tastes, some of the complaints are frankly whiney and miss the bigger picture.

One mockup I saw on here did a great job illustrating how a Yautja’s cranial structure and deadlocks might logically develop over time. Considering that Yautja are long-lived with some sources even saying thousands of years, it’s reasonable to think that their physiology would continue to change over such massive spans of time. Gradual, distinguishable shifts, like deadlocks being pushed further toward the back of the skull to accommodate a growing cranial crest, make perfect biological sense to me.

This isn’t a wild departure that “ruins” the lore or undermines the IP, it’s a naturalistic development that I think still respects the creature’s biology and history. Variation within a species, especially among age groups, is not just realistic but it actually adds more depth to the world building.

It’s especially silly to blame Disney for this change when Prey, released under Disney’s ownership, was widely praised and respected the spirit of the Predator franchise far better than The Predator (2018) did. Badlands looks like it’s taking some creative risks while still honoring the core elements that make the Yautja iconic and I think that should be celebrated, not knee-jerk rejected because of a slight shift in hairline placement.

I think Dek looks fine. I’m not claiming his design is perfect or that everyone needs to love it. I’m simply saying that it fits, it makes sense, and it’s nowhere near the catastrophe some people are making it out to be.",Plot/Story/Interpretation/Analysis

[**Metacritic:**](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/predator-badlands/) 71 (40 Reviews)

**Sample Reviews:**

Justine Smith, Little White Lies - Considering the film’s attention to detail in creating a planet brimming with unusual lifeforms, it is an absolute waste to relegate the film’s climax to what looks like a dark backlot. **2/5**

Adam Graham, Detroit News - ""Badlands"" still delivers the action that fans crave, but it finds new life in the ""Predator"" series precisely by not being so precious about itself or its lore. **B+**

Mark Kermode, Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube) - I was unengaged by it.

Bilge Ebiri, New York Magazine/Vulture - Predator: Badlands is a charming surprise.

Matt Singer, ScreenCrush - The best Predator since the first film. **8/10**

Odie Henderson, Boston Globe - Despite the danger-filled sequences, Dek’s quest for revenge, and creature-on-creature violence, this film is a screwball comedy. And not just any screwball comedy, either; “Predator: Badlands” is “It Happened One Night” with a Predator monster. **3.5/4**

Kyle Smith, Wall Street Journal - All in good fun for a B-movie, and “P: B” does not pretend to be anything else.

Bob Strauss, San Francisco Chronicle - Inhuman though it may be, this is far-and-away the most humane of “Predators,” expanding rather than skimping on the series’ blood hunt fundamentals. **4/4**

Adam Nayman, Toronto Star - All of this is reasonably absorbing, with Trachtenberg once again proving a spirited -- if conventional -- purveyor of B-movie tropes and thrills, albeit in a slightly anodyne register. **2.5/4**

Trevor Lenzmeier, Seattle Times - Ultimately, “Badlands” is a fun weekend watch for your home theater — but it won’t leave a lasting impression. **2/4**

Manohla Dargis, New York Times - In classic genre fashion, the filmmakers here are refreshing the franchise with both new ideas and elements from older installments and other touchstones.

Richard Whittaker, Austin Chronicle - Schuster-Koloamatangi plays Dek with a certain pompous exasperation that, even under layers of latex and CG, is undeniably and deliberately hilarious. If it bleeds, you can laugh at it. **3.5/5**

Jake Wilson, Sydney Morning Herald - A Predator who learns to care: it seems like a bit much. Still, Dek softens only to a point – and the moral message of the climax is as jumbled than everything else... **2.5/5**

Tim Robey, Daily Telegraph (UK) - The energy, gruesome thrills and craziness of this flick are hard not to admire. **4/5**

Liz Shannon Miller, Consequence - Badlands flips the approach and finds something fresh and wonderful and bold as a result — as if James Cameron had made Terminator 2 entirely from the T-800’s point of view. **A-**

Justin Clark, Slant Magazine - The action is horrifying, inventive, and heart-pounding, but it’s also the least surprising part of Predator: Badlands. **3/4**

Matt Zoller Seitz, [RogerEbert.com](http://RogerEbert.com) \- The takeaway, I think, is applicable to beings all across the universe: sometimes the things you want most are not worth wanting, and until you figure that out, you’ll never be free. **4/4**

Perri Nemiroff, Perri Nemiroff (YouTube) - I don’t think I’ll ever get over the fact that we have a Predator film that’s essentially an alien and robot buddy movie. It’s so refreshing to see a film franchise dish out something so unexpected. **4.5/5**

Olly Richards, Time Out - It cleverly pulls at the supposed laws of the series in a way that makes it more interesting without diluting the fearsome nature of the title character. Trachtenberg is making the franchise richer with every instalment. **4/5**

Nick De Semlyen, Empire Magazine - Badlands is big popcorn fun, a geeky commingling of lurid sci-fi, comedy and rowdy action that gets high off its own supply. **4/5**

Jarrod Jones, AV Club - The mystique of the Predator, what it was and where it came from, was best left to the imagination; the second you start pulling at that thread, the whole idea falls apart. **C**

Tim Grierson, Screen International - Reconceiving the iconic sci-fi villain as an underdog hero, Predator: Badlands is a consistently entertaining action-thriller filled with propulsive set pieces.

Mark Kennedy, Associated Press - It’s hard to underestimate Fanning here, who keeps us interested. She doesn’t just add comic relief, she adds a much-needed human element. **2.5/4**

Meagan Navarro, Bloody Disgusting - The Predator franchise takes a sharp detour into adventure, with its propulsive, creature-filled action matching the polarizing thrills of Yautja innovation. **3.5/5**

Alonso Duralde, The Film Verdict - Between the wise-cracking sidekick, the adorable non-verbal pet, and the protagonist who undergoes personal growth, Predator: Badlands often resembles the pilot of a vintage Saturday-morning cartoon — but that’s not necessarily a bad thing.

Linda Marric, HeyUGuys - Bold, bizarre, and unexpectedly moving, it’s the kind of risk-taking sci-fi we don’t see enough of nowadays. **4/5**

Peter Debruge, Variety - The strongest film with “Predator” in the title since the 1987 original (Trachtenberg’s earlier “Prey” notwithstanding).

David Ehrlich, IndieWire - By reckoning with the series’ fundamental weakness rather than continuing to pretend that it’s the series’ greatest strength, Trachtenberg has made the brand richer than ever before. **B+**

Barry Hertz, Globe and Mail - A sometimes inventive but too frequently anemic effort to expand the proudly R-rated Predator-verse into the mass-market appeal of PG sterility.

David Fear, Rolling Stone - It’s really a comedic road movie at heart, with as much yuks over a mismatched pair trying to get along as yucks involving the goopy innards of cosmic mastodons.

William Bibbiani, TheWrap - Like 'Prey' before it, 'Predator: Badlands' is mainstream sci-fi filmmaking at its zenith, and it’s proof — in an era where proof is hard to find — that big, expensive action spectacles don’t have to suck.

Richard Lawson, The Hollywood Reporter - The film simply wants to be the best version of a zillionth Predator installment that it can be. If it has to complicate -- and, yes, soften -- the branding to do that, so be it.

Nick Schager, The Daily Beast - The series’ second-best installment and a rousing start to what appears to be a grand new franchise future.

Peter Bradshaw, Guardian - The sheer pointlessness of everything that happens subtracts the oxygen and even Fanning’s imperishable star quality can’t save it. **2/5**

"I worked at the actual Toys ""R"" Us during the events of the movie Roofman. Ask me anything","Second edit to add: At the time of writing I had not seen the movie, but I did go see it opening day. I really liked it, and I appreciate the writer/director's vision, even if some aspects of the true story were altered or omitted. Absolutely worth a watch, no question.

Edit to add: I put a sketch of the store layout in the comments to show where Jeff's hideout was inside the store and where his tunnel to the Circuit City was.



I have not seen the movie yet (only the trailers), nor was I involved in the production in any way. I tried so hard to be involved, but every avenue I pursued was met with either silence or a kind but definitive, ""there is nothing we need from you."" I guess all that is to say that I have no inside information about the movie whatsoever, nor can I speak definitely on why any decisions about the story being told in the movie were made. I only know what I experienced while the events unfolded, and what my coworkers told me of their experiences.

I began working at the Independence Blvd. Toys 'R' Us in 1999 when I was still in high school, until around the middle of 2005. I worked weekends, holidays, and summers to fit my school schedule, and as the store could afford to take me on, since they didn't have a large employment budget and only managers and supervisors were eligible for full-time status. I began as a cashier, and my responsibilities were eventually expanded to floor sales (which was really a catch-all for a very wide range of activities), until I was ultimately promoted to work in the electronics department ('R'Zone) and entrusted with a security access to the high dollar items there. Also, once it was discovered that Jeffrey was living behind the wall, I actually got to go into his lair before it got cleaned out.

Looking at the trailers, the movie does seem to be getting a lot right. Based on interviews, I know they spoke extensively with Jeffrey Manchester and many people involved in the events. They even cast some of those people in small roles (quite glaringly is the distinct absence in the marketing materials of any TRU employees being involved in any way). As far as what they got wrong... Here are a few to get things started:

- Perhaps the most glaring and surprising change to the story is that Jeff's girlfriend, Leigh, was absolutely not a TRU employee. We would have all known and been extremely creeped out (even more than we already were!) if this had been the case.

- They seem to be omitting a major part of the story, which is that there was an abandoned Circuit City attached to the TRU which Jeffrey connected via a hole in the storeroom wall and created a second lair. I also crawled through the hole after the fact and saw this second space before it got cleared out.
       - Related to the abandoned Circuit City, Jeffrey did not set up his baby monitor surveillance system out in plain sight. He drilled holes in the adjoining wall from the Circuit City and placed the cameras there, which hid them far more effectively.

- There was no store manager at the time that acted in any way how Peter Dinklage's character acts. The managers and comanagers were all kind, if overworked and stressed, and would *never* have sneered at a request to participate in a toy drive (the answer may have been out of their hands, but they would not have been condescending about it). I suspect they are making the Dinklage character out to be the ""bad guy"" of the movie. Which is also weird because, you know, the employee were the victims.
- Small thing, but our name tags were much smaller, had different designs, and were oval shaped. Also, our uniforms were red button-down shirts and black pants.

That's all I can think of for now. Ask away!",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

Some Reviews:

[Empire - Sophie Butcher](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/roofman/) \- 4 / 5

&gt;Derek Cianfrance delivers a hugely empathetic, very entertaining depiction of an extraordinary life, featuring one of Channing Tatum’s best performances. Expect laughs, tears, and noughties nostalgia.

[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/roofman-review-channing-tatum-1236510112/)

&gt;In the end, it’s the through-the-roof chemistry between the two leads that makes the film worthy of repeat viewing. Tatum is no longer the cocky teenager he was in the “Step Up” movies all those years ago, as the star’s affected swagger has eased into a natural confidence, while Dunst brings just the right amount of wariness to a woman who’s devoted to her kids and devout in her faith. While she plays Leigh as closed off to love, leave it to Tatum to find that unconventional point of entry.

[TheWrap - Steve Pond](https://www.thewrap.com/roofman-review-channing-tatum-and-kirsten-dunst-are-a-charmingly-doomed-couple-in-dark-rom-com/)

&gt;The tonal juggling act isn’t always seamless, but in a way, the contradictions are what give Roofman its life. It’s a sad movie, really, but it’s also a lot of fun. And if that doesn’t make sense, maybe it’s the whole point.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
Thoughts on Roofman?,"I genuinely enjoyed this movie, more than I was expecting actually.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
Question about Jeffrey Manchester aka “The Roofman.,"I’m sure some of are  aware of Jeffrey Manchester otherwise known as “The Roofman.” He was a spree-robber and former United States Army Reserve officer who robbed up to 40-60 McDonald’s restaurants throughout the country from 1998- 2000, entering them by drilling through the roof and dropping in.

 He was eventually arrested and imprisoned. About four years into his sentence, he broke out and relocated to another state, changing his identity. He  ended up living in a Toys ""R"" Us store, staying in backrooms and other areas inside, surviving on kids' snacks and baby food, and exercising during the night when the store was closed by riding a bike throughout the store aisles. During the holiday rush of December 2004, Manchester moved his living quarters to an abandoned Circuit City next-door to avoid detection, creating a room under a stairwell where he painted the walls, put up posters, and passed the time watching movies during the day.

Between June and January of the following year, he devised an elaborate plan to takeover and rob the Toys ""R"" Us in his biggest robbery to-date, setting up an elaborate surveillance system throughout the store using baby monitors, and even subtly changing employee schedules to accommodate his plans. As time passed, he came under more and more suspicion as employees noticed many missing items as a result of Manchester's residence, making his plans tighter.

Edit:

By that time, he became a member of the community to bide time until the robbery, even dating a local woman, and joining a Church. He spent a large a lot of his time with her and her kids, bringing them toys he had taken from the store he lived at, and covering his seeming unemployment and homelessness with secretive whispers about a highly-confidential job for the government, saying his quarters were in a restricted office building.

Before carrying out the big Toys ""R"" Us robbery, He burned down a dentist's office where he had gotten work on his teeth done during his time there, to eliminate his dental records and reportedly robbed a pawn shop to acquire a gun in preparation for the robbery. On the morning of December 26, robbed the Toys ""R"" Us, taking an unknown amount of cash before being forced to flee after two employees were able to slip out of the store to get law enforcement, leading to police discovery of His secret lodgings in Circuit City and discovering the only fingerprint in the room, which was ironically on a DVD of ""Catch Me If You Can"".

Oddly enough, he didn’t flee town after committing the Robby. After his girlfriend found out his true identity, who she believed to be a man named ""John Zorn"", the police convinced her to call Him to her home where he was recaptured upon arrival. His expected release date is December 4, 2036.

Anyway, I’m kind of rambling here, To anyone familiar with this case, I’m very interested to know what he Toys “R” Us mancave/hideout looked like. Unfortunately there aren’t any photos anywhere on the internet, but apparently there are articles that talk about it. Can anyone here provide links to the articles that detail its appearance?

A24's 'The Smashing Machine' collapses a steep 69% on its second weekend.","https://preview.redd.it/egqb42j5jyuf1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2215a8d9293f221e2811a3e6058d338a7e22f45d

Third time's not the charm.

Disney tried again in making the ***Tron*** franchise happen, and the result was one of the year's biggest flops. Paramount's ***Roofman*** also debuted with solid numbers, although it also shows the difficulty of selling original comedies. And Jennifer Lopez had one of her worst debuts as lead star with ***Kiss of the Spider Woman***.

The Top 10 earned a combined $64.0 million this weekend. That's slightly down from last year, when ***Terrifier 3*** opened with an impressive debut, and ***Joker: Folie à Deux*** collapsed a steep 81.4%.

Debuting at #1, Disney's ***Tron: Ares*** flopped with just $33.2 million in 4,000 theaters. That's below ***Tron: Legacy***'s debut ($44.0 million), which is crazy considering this had so much inflation on its side. There's no point comparing it to the 1982 in terms of opening weekend.

Given that this cost $180 million ($10 million more than ***Legacy***), it's absolutely disappointing that ***Ares*** opened below it. In fact, the performance is eerily similar to the box office failure of ***Blade Runner 2049***: a sci-fi sequel released in October with a $180 million budget, but it could only open to $32.7 million. 

There was a time for a ***Tron*** film, and it seems like Disney just waited too long to capitalize on it, and also took multiple wrong decisions. First, 15 years is way too long to release a sequel. Yes, ***Legacy*** released 28 years later, but Disney effectively sold the film as an original piece that would intrigue newcomers and also attract old fans. For many, this was probably the first ***Tron***, so ***Ares*** lacked the novelty aspect.

But there's a bigger problem, and it's that ***Tron*** is just not a very successful franchise in terms of box office. The original ***Tron*** made over $50 million worldwide back in 1982, but Disney was reportedly disappointed with its performance, which is why they didn't pursue a sequel. It wasn't until 2005, when Sean Bailey advocated for the film after it garnered a cult following. The result was ***Tron: Legacy*** in 2010, but even though it made $409 million worldwide, the high costs once again disappointed Disney. So you can see that the franchise has performed the studio's expectations twice.

While ***Legacy*** also grew on to earn a cult following, Disney didn't really chase the audience. In March 2015, they finally greenlit a ***Legacy*** sequel, with Garrett Hedlund and Olivia Wilde reprising their roles, and Joseph Kosinski returning as director. But just two months later, they scrapped the film after the failure of ***Tomorrowland***. And so everyone involved moved to different projects.

Until in 2017, Jared Leto began circling a new ***Tron*** film. It didn't fully gain traction until 2023, when Joachim Rønning signed as director, with Leto serving as producer. But the film's lack of connection to ***Legacy*** ended up hurting the film; while it could help a newcomer join the film without watching the prior films, it also lost fans of the previous film. Hell, even Jeff Bridges' presence was limited in the marketing and in the final product. 

The film was also hurt by its Leto connection; he's not really well-regarded by audiences, and sexual misconduct accusations from a few months ago also signaled problem. Double-edged sword though; if Leto didn't advocate and produce, the film wouldn't exist. The marketing was also a mixed bag; they highlighted that the Grid was coming to the real world, when the appeal of ***Tron*** is staying in the Grid. And the film's mediocre reception (56% on RT) was the nail in the coffin. It lost ***Legacy*** fans, and it didn't really intrigue non-fans.

According to Disney, 68% of the audience was male. Gen Z and Millennials were its biggest audience; 52% was 18-34. No interest in the people who watched the original back in 1982 though; only 25% of the audience was 45 and over. They gave it a middling ""B+"" on CinemaScore, the exact same score as the previous films. It has no holiday legs to hold well like ***Legacy***, and it's unlikely it adds new fans in the next few weeks when it loses IMAX and PLF. For now, a $85 million domestic total for ***Ares*** is likely. Very, very poor numbers. It means it will have less attendance than the original ***Tron*** ($110 million adjusted).

In second place, Paramount's ***Roofman*** debuted with $8.1 million in 3,362 theaters. This is director Derek Cianfrance's biggest debut, overtaking ***The Place Beyond the Pines*** ($4.9 million), although in fairness, he never had a single film playing in more than 1,600 theaters. The debut was above Channing Tatum's previous film ***Blink Twice*** ($7.3 million), but below ***Fly Me to the Moon*** ($9.4 million).

The budget was kept low at $19 million, so this is a solid debut. It simply shows how difficult it can be to sell comedies, especially when it also involves crime. Even with its crazy real-life story, which was plastered all over the marketing, the audience was very limited in giving it a chance. Even though Paramount tried to build buzz by sending it to Toronto, it was still a challenge even with great reviews on its side (85% on RT).

According to Paramount, 53% of the audience was male, and its biggest audience was women over 25 at 38%, thanks to Tatum's presence. They gave it a ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is solid for a film like this. These kinds of films are noted for holding well, and with a weak October ahead, perhaps it could have a decent run. For now, ***Roofman*** should hit close to $30 million domestically.

Even though it lost IMAX and PLF screens, ***One Battle After Another*** had a better drop than last week. It eased just 38%, adding $6.8 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $54.6 million, and it should continue holding well for the rest of the month.

After its steep drop last week, ***Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie*** recovered by dropping 35%, for a $3.5 million weekend. The film has earned $26.5 million domestically, and it should finish with a little above $35 million domestically.

In fifth place, ***The Conjuring: Last Rites*** dropped just 25% this weekend, for a $3.1 million weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $172.6 million.

Sony released ***Soul on Fire*** in 1,720 theaters, earning an okay $2.8 million this weekend. Even with an ""A"" on CinemaScore, it'd be a surprise if it reached $10 million.

***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle*** dropped 36%, for a $2.2 million weekend. With $128.6 million, it has officially passed ***Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon*** ($128.5 million) to become the biggest non-English film domestically.

A24's ***The Smashing Machine*** had a very poor debut last week, and its second weekend reflects that audiences are abandoning the ship as soon as possible. The film collapsed all the way to eighth place with a horrible 69%, which is a pathetic $1.7 million weekend. That translates to a very weak $541 per-theater average. A drop like this is not surprising, considering the film's divisive word of mouth. Through 10 days, the film has earned an abysmal $9.8 million. With such a poor per-theater average, it's gonna lose tons of theaters this week. The film is now guaranteed to miss $15 million domestically, and could even miss $12 million depending on its drop next week. It's gonna be Dwayne Johnson's worst ever wide release. It's crazy that despite its high $50 million budget, the film is not gonna be in A24's top 25 highest grossing films.

***The Strangers: Chapter 2*** dropped 42%, adding $1.6 million this weekend. Its domestic total stands at $13.5 million, and it doesn't have much left in the tank.

Rounding out the top 10 was IFC's ***Good Boy***. It dropped a pretty good 40%, for a $1.4 million weekend. Through 10 days, the film has made $4.9 million so far.

***The Long Walk*** continues holding well. It eased just 39%, grossing $1 million. That took its domestic total to $33.9 million.

In 12th place, Roadside Attractions' ***Kiss of the Spider Woman*** flopped with an abysmal $891,046 in 1,331 theaters. That's Jennifer Lopez's worst ever wide debut, and it translates to a meager $669 per-theater average. Unsurprisingly, the film just couldn't connect with audiences. With little award buzz, the film is going to disappear quickly from theaters. Needless to say, it won't come anywhere close to the 1985 original's domestic gross ($17 million).

Amazon MGM released Luca Guadagnino's ***After the Hunt*** in 6 theaters. It earned $158,679, which is a solid $26,447 per-theater average. It's set to expand into around 1,200 theaters this weekend.

A24 also released ***If I Had Legs I'd Kick You*** in 4 theaters. It earned $89,164, averaging $22,291 in each theater. It will continue adding theaters in the next few weeks.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Tron: Ares*** also got off to a very weak start outside America. It opened with just $26.7 million overseas, for a very poor $59.9 million worldwide debut. It had very soft to mediocre debuts in Mexico ($2.9M), the UK ($2.4M), France ($1.9M), Australia ($1.5M) and Germany ($1.4M). Given its massive $180 million budget, the film's path to profitability is going to be insanely hard. Nowhere close to ***Legacy***'s $409 million worldwide finish. We'd like to say that this is the nail in the coffin for the franchise, but let's face it, we'll probably see another one in 15-20 years.

***One Battle After Another*** added $15 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $138.1 million. The best markets are the UK ($11.2M), France ($8.5M), Germany ($6.4M), Italy ($4.4M) and Australia ($4M). It reaches its final market, China, this week.

***Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie*** added $7 million, for a $46.3 million worldwide total. Its best markets are Australia ($2.9M), Mexico ($2M), Italy ($1.7M), France ($1.1M) and Poland ($1.1M).

***The Conjuring: Last Rites*** has crossed $300 million overseas, and its worldwide total is now $473 million. Best markets are Mexico ($30.5M), the UK ($24.1M), France ($22.3M), Brazil ($17.5M) and Germany ($16.4M).

With $648 million worldwide, ***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle*** is now officially the fifth biggest film of the year.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*A Big Bold Beautiful Journey* | Sep/19 | Sony | $3,252,578 | $6,671,082 | $20,171,082 | $45M

- There's nothing beautiful about this. Sony's ***A Big Bold Beautiful Journey*** has closed after just 3 weeks with an abysmal $6 million domestically and $20 million worldwide. A big failure, even considering its mid $45 million budget. A huge, huge stain in the careers of Margot Robbie, Colin Farrell, and director Kogonada. Even with the talent, poor reviews and word of mouth sank the film. Ouch.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

Universal is releasing Blumhouse's ***Black Phone 2***. Despite the original's ending, Ethan Hawke is back, going full Freddy Krueger mode. Given that it surprised everyone by grossing $161 million worldwide, a sequel felt inevitable. But there's still questions over whether the audience is on board with a sequel, and Blumhouse's brand has taken a massive dive in the past year with so many failures. Will this save them?

Lionsgate is releasing Aziz Ansari's directorial debut ***Good Fortune***, starring Ansari, Seth Rogen and Keanu Reeves. It seeks to bring comedy into theaters, with a fantasy angle (a guardian angel causes a body swap and shenanigans ensue). It had a solid response in Toronto (83% on RT), but it remains to be seen if audiences will show up.

In limited release, Sony Pictures Classics is releasing Richard Linklater's ***Blue Moon***, starring Ethan Hawke, Margaret Qualley, Bobby Cannavale, and Andrew Scott. With high acclaim (97% on RT, 78 on Metacritic), look for this to have one of the year's strongest per-theater averages.

Worst theatre experience tonight during roofman,"After a terrible week I finally decided to treat myself and see the new movie roofman. 

I usually don’t see movies on Fridays or Saturdays but figured what could go wrong. 

I’m sitting on an end seat and the entire first half of the movie I hear a guy tapping his foot like he needs to use the bathroom really badly. Which already interrupted the film. 

Then finally after 30 minutes he finally decides to get up and go to the restroom. 

He must have missed a step due to running down the stairs but out of nowhere he comes tumbling down next to me knocking my drink over. Which I don’t think he even noticed. This whole ordeal really took me out of the cinematic experience 


Luckily he was okay. But my theatre experience was ruined and I won’t be going back. ",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
Sorry to those watching Roofman with me.,"My most embarrassing moment yet. Spur of the moment decided to go watch Roofman. Because it was such a last minute decision, I didn’t time my liquid consumption well and needed to pee about halfway through the movie. Fortunately there was no one else in my row and I could get to the stairs easily. Unfortunately, I missed a step and crashed/rolled my way down the stairs. I’m totally fine and the adrenaline got me up fast and to the bathroom but this is a public apology to anyone who witnessed that. 

Anyway that was a great movie! Maybe I fell because I was on the edge of my seat, highly recommend y’all watch",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

'Roofman' Review Thread,"I will continue to update this post as reviews come in.

[**Rotten Tomatoes:**](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/roofman) Certified Fresh

**Critics Consensus:** A disarmingly sweet tonal gearshift for director Derek Cianfrance, *Roofman* is shaggy as a narrative but expertly tailored to Channing Tatum's strengths as an eminently likable leading man.

|Critics|Score|**Number of Reviews**|Average Rating (Unofficial)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**All Critics**|85%|115|7.10/10|
|**Top Critics**|70%|23|6.40/10|

[**Metacritic:**](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/roofman/) 64 (29 Reviews)

**Sample Reviews:**

Katie Walsh, Tribune News Service - Roofman is predominantly a one-man showcase for the full range of Tatum's talents, but the entire ensemble is crucial for any good caper. Dunst's prowess pushes his own performance, while Peter Dinklage offers levity as the stern store manager Mitch. **3/4**

Robert Abele, Los Angeles Times - Roofman, with its breezy decency, knows how to finesse just the right amount of compassion for larceny.

Michael Ordoña, San Francisco Chronicle - “Roofman” hooks viewers with its compelling depiction of a person too smart for his own good. It’s funny and moving, however close to or far from the real events it may be. **3/4**

Natalia Winkelman, New York Times - Here is a protagonist who clearly straddles the line between right and wrong; the trouble is that in “Roofman,” that line wobbles, leaving the movie somewhere between a fun-loving caper and a finger-wagging morality tale.

Rafer Guzman, Newsday - Lived-in performances and a sensitive screenplay make for a thoroughly engaging comedy-drama. **3/4**

Kyle Smith, Wall Street Journal - A master class in how not to direct a comedy. With its slow pacing, shaky handheld cameras, dishwater cinematography and unnervingly extreme closeups, it feels more like an intense indie drama than a whimsical tale of a robber with a peculiar M.O.

Lindsey Bahr, Associated Press -The film succeeds in doing what it aimed for: Presenting a humane portrait of a guy who will be serving most of his life behind bars, in crowd-pleasing packaging. **2.5/4**

David Fear, Rolling Stone - It’s a movie that stumbles every so often, overplays its hand numerous time, and relies on an oddball true-story premise and 1000-watt star power to pave over some of the rougher spots. It would also give you its coat if you needed it without asking.

Radheyan Simonpillai, Globe and Mail - The struggle for Cianfrance is getting the tone right with a story about a superficially chivalrous thief who nurtures a sense of kinship with the people he ultimately victimizes.

Odie Henderson, Boston Globe - Tatum’s sparkling charm can only take him so far; the script, by Cianfrance and Kirt Gunn, spends way too much time on a romantic subplot filled with sitcom scenarios and uninteresting characters. **2/4**

Billie Melissa, Newsweek - Cianfrance's Roofman finds the perfect balance between suspense, heart, and pure entertainment, making it one of the most enjoyable watches of 2025.

Kristen Lopez, The Film Maven - Roofman succeeds on Channing Tatum's charm which covers up for a pretty thin script. Cianfrance tells another story about personal choice that, unlike his past work, does feel lighter and more hopeful. **C**

Sophie Butcher, Empire Magazine - Derek Cianfrance delivers a hugely empathetic, very entertaining depiction of an extraordinary life, featuring one of Channing Tatum’s best performances. Expect laughs, tears, and noughties nostalgia. **4/5**

Thelma Adams, AARP Movies for Grownups - An incredibly tender love story develops at the heart of this American true-crime caper. **5/5**

Kristy Puchko, Mashable - Roofman is a frustrating watch, refusing to fit into the genre expectations. But that might be precisely the point.

Mark Hanson, Slant Magazine - The real Jeffrey Manchester may in fact have been polite, but Derek Cianfrance’s film doesn’t convince you that it needed to be as well. **2/4**

Tim Grierson, Screen International - The film tries so hard to paint Jeffrey as an endearingly flawed curiosity that he lacks the rough edges or mystery that would make such a person compelling.

David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter - This is the kind of disarming crowd-pleaser for which cringe-inducing clichés like “it will sneak up and steal your heart” were invented. What’s refreshing about Roofman is that it’s never too aggressive about it. It’s sentimental but sincere.

Marya E. Gates, [RogerEbert.com](http://RogerEbert.com) \- ‘Roofman’ is a slick but incurious film that is so preoccupied with showing the what of Manchester’s story that it doesn’t bother to examine the why. **2/4**

Benjamin Lee, Guardian - It works mostly because of Tatum and Dunst, a rare on-screen pairing of single parents in their 40s, both trying to navigate a stressful situation, hard enough even without the criminality. There’s real chemistry there. **3/5**

Steve Pond, TheWrap - The tonal juggling act isn’t always seamless, but in a way, the contradictions are what give “Roofman” its life. It’s a sad movie, really, but it’s also a lot of fun. And if that doesn’t make sense, maybe it’s the whole point.

Katie Rife, IndieWire - Unfortunately, however, “Roofman” also capitulates to the feel-good demands of Hollywood storytelling, leaving the pricklier aspects of Manchester’s story on the table. And the film is forgettable as a result. **C+**

Peter Debruge, Variety - In the end, it’s the through-the-roof chemistry between the two leads that makes the film worthy of repeat viewing.

**SYNOPSIS:**

Based on an unbelievable true story, Roofman follows Jeffrey Manchester (Channing Tatum), a former Army Ranger and struggling father who turns to robbing McDonald’s restaurants by cutting holes in their roofs, earning him the nickname: Roofman. After escaping prison, he secretly lives inside a Toys “R” Us for six months, surviving undetected while planning his next move. But when he falls for Leigh (Kirsten Dunst), a divorced mom drawn to his undeniable charm, his double life begins to unravel, setting off a compelling and suspenseful game of cat and mouse as his past closes in.

Roofman Thoughts ?,"Finally got to see Roofman yesterday and really, really enjoyed it. It was a surprising mature turn in direction from Derek Cianfrance who also helmed Place Beyond The Pines. Channing Tatum has played this type of character before, but his turn as Jeffrey Manchester I think is his Apex. The way that he acts with kids, the charm that he has with just about everyone and the goodness that exists in his character all feel genuine. 

But at the same time you know that what he's doing is wrong, but he just can't escape the bad decisions that he continues to make, which are presented to be understandabIe. It leaves you wondering when the other shor is going to drop.

Thought that Tatum and Dunst had really good chemistry, and there are a few scenes that were so heartbreaking. 

Also, as someone who was a teenager in that era, having this take place in 2004 was awesome with the popular stores and restaurants at the time and also seeing those prices back then lol. But I think the movie is a lot of fun and offers a lot to people, I hope it's able to make it's money because I think it's a well crafted true story that is memorable. ",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

Can we talk about the truly insane billing in Roofman?,"Feel the need to post this here as I've been thinking about it non-stop since I saw the movie yesterday. The credits begin and it goes...

Channing Tatum (obviously), Kirsten Dunst (of course)...

Now, I'm assuming third-billed will either be LaKeith Stanfield who is obviously the most famous person in this movie besides the Dink (who I know has to be the ""And"" and is indeed the ""And"") and a pretty important role... or LaKeith has secured the ""With"" credit and it's going to be Juno Temple getting third because of her Ted Lasso credentials and sharing most of her scenes with LaKeith.

The third-billed actor is Ben Mendelsohn! He's in the movie for maybe five minutes as the pastor at the church Channing and Kirsten go to and has basically no scenes with serious dramatic *or* comedic heft to them. I laughed when he appeared initially in the movie because it's Ben Mendelsohn with long hair but that's the entirety of his role.

But you know what, okay, because LaKeith probably secured the ""with"" and Mendelsohn is a blockbuster villain actor and presumably decent buddies with Cianfrance after The Place Beyond the Pines - wait what? LaKeith got fourth billing after Mendelsohn who has *no* plot importance in the movie and no real role in the movie at all???

LaKeith should've either got third billing or the ""with"" for Roofman and the fact that he didn't and lost it to a cameo-sized role for Ben Mendelsohn means he should fire his agent. I'm sorry if this is too dramatic but this was insane billing.",Plot/Story/Interpretation/Analysis

GME related easter eggs found in the new film Roofman (2025),"The movie follows a true story of an escaped convict that hides out inside a Toys 'R' Us. If you're aware of Toys 'R' Us' fate, you'd know the same death spiral plan that ended them was also in motion for Gamestop prior to Ryan taking over the board.

*Moving on*

During the film, in the back office there is a 'Hang in there' poster on the wall that gets shown several times throughout the film, probably nothing.

Putting that aside, the main one that piqued my interest is later on in the film when the main character is obtaining a fake passport, the name given to him was **Kenneth Griffin.**

Could it be a coincidence? Quite likely, but that mostly depends whether you believe in coincidences. Personally, a Kenny G name drop in a movie that takes place inside a Toys 'R' Us is enough to make me grab my tinfoil hat.

"The Running Man, One Battle After Another, Caught Stealing and Roofman, are all the same story told in four different films.","I just got out of seeing The Running Man today and it made me think about how the four movies mentioned above have all come out this year with the same three major story pieces;

1. A everyday man with interesting qualities

2. Capitalism/greed/the police state wrongs him in some way

3. He goes to extreme lengths to find a resolution that corrects this wrong

I know these pieces are pretty general and are widely applicable to many movies, but I think all four of these movies have almost identical parts. While they are all told in extremely different ways, their endings, plot points, and characters are almost completely interchangeable with one another depending on how authentic or critical the movie is trying to be. It’s also interesting that the four lead male roles are played by leading men that ruled their decades (Tatum and DiCaprio in the 2010’s, Butler and Powell in the 2020’s.)

The overarching theme however, is what effects late stage capitalism and a police state have on a person and what lengths that person will go to, to avenge their misgivings. Almost all characters lose something (usually family) or are threatened with losing them. There is such a fervent undertone in all of these movies about how untrustworthy, scheming, and vile capitalist/police state actors are. I find it to be uniquely tied to our current political moment in the 2020’s, but all movies go about speaking on that message so differently. Caught Stealing and Roofman are far more subtle, OBAA and The Running Man are far more direct. They’re all in different genre’s as well, so the way in which they make their social critiques are vastly different, but they all point to a mistrust of power, and an urgent call to fight back, in an extreme way, against it (whether it be  living in a Toy’s R’ Us and finding a new family despite the police state branding you unfit for society, or blowing a hole through a network TV head’s. . .head.) 

But all of their endings kind of don’t fit their movies. I wish Roofman had Caught Stealing’s ending (I know it was based on a real story but still), I wish Caught Stealing had OBAA’s ending, OBAA had The Running Man’s ending, and The Running Man had Roofman’s ending. I think that order would allow each of these movies to have the best and most effective impact on audiences if the message is to mistrust power. 

I’ll admit, Caught Stealing is the least revenant movie here, but I feel like its plot is so close to being in this category, and could easily be just as socially critical as the running man if a few plot points were changed or lines of dialogue added in. If Austin Butler’s character lost his mom to a curable illness instead of getting into a car crash that prevents him from being goated at baseball, I think caught stealing could be on par with One Battle After Another in terms of how uniquely American and modern its story is (yes I know it takes place in the 90’s but its story still feels so connected to the modern day. And its slice of life late 90’s in New York vibe is extremely appealing.)

Welcome to the newest edition of r/BoxOffice Long Range Forecast.

We're making long range predictions for films, 4 weeks out from their premieres. You will predict the opening weekend, domestic total and worldwide gross of these films. These predictions will be open for 48 hours and the results will be polled to form a consensus and posted the next week.

So let's meet the three films for the week and analyze each pro and con.

#**Tron: Ares**

The film is directed by Joachim Rønning (*Kon Tiki*, *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales*, *Maleficent: Mistress of Evil*, *Young Woman and the Sea*) from a screenplay by Jesse Wigutow, based on a story by David Digilio and Wigutow. It is the third installment in the *Tron* series, and stars Jared Leto (who also produces), Greta Lee, Evan Peters, Jodie Turner-Smith, Hasan Minhaj, Arturo Castro, Cameron Monaghan, Gillian Anderson, and Jeff Bridges. It follows a highly sophisticated program, Ares, who is sent from the digital world into the real world on a dangerous mission, marking humankind's first encounter with A.I. beings.

#**Roofman**

The film is directed by Derek Cianfrance (*Blue Valentine*, *The Place Beyond the Pines* and *The Light Between Oceans*), from a screenplay by Cianfrance and Kirt Gunn. The film stars Channing Tatum, Kirsten Dunst, Ben Mendelsohn, LaKeith Stanfield, Juno Temple, Melonie Diaz, Uzo Aduba, Lily Collias, Jimmy O. Yang, and Peter Dinklage. The film is a biopic of the fugitive Jeffrey Manchester, a former United States Army Reserve officer, known colloquially as Roofman due to his propensity to steal from branches of McDonald's after entering their premises via the roof. Most notably, he evaded capture by police by hiding in the wall of a Toys ""R"" Us store.

#**After the Hunt**

The film is directed by Luca Guadagnino (*A Bigger Splash*, *Call Me By Your Name*, *Suspiria*, *Challengers*, *Queer*, etc.) and written by Nora Garrett. Starring Julia Roberts, Ayo Edebiri, Andrew Garfield, Michael Stuhlbarg and Chloë Sevigny, it follows Alma, a college professor caught in between a sexual abuse accusation involving one of her students and a colleague.

Now that you've met this week's new releases, let's look at some pros and cons.

#**PROS**

- The *Tron* franchise has grown a massive cult following in subsequent years. *Tron: Legacy* still made $400 million worldwide, indicating that audiences were very interested in the world of these films. And its popularity has grown through home media and streaming. The trailers emphasize that it's the same old *Tron*, just that it made its way to the real world. So far, all trailers have been visually stunning. It also stars a cast ensemble of known actors, or actors who are on their way up. While Daft Punk is not back for the score, Nine Inch Nails is a pretty well respected and highly regarded successor. But most importantly: its biggest advantage is that it's the sole high-budget blockbuster of October, now that *Mortal Kombat II* was moved to May 2026.

- Channing Tatum is one of the most popular male stars. *Dog* got to $85 million solely on his own, and his team-up film with Sandra Bullock in *The Lost City* made its way to $190 million. Not to mention a lot of pre-pandemic hits. So *Roofman* is highly dependent on how much audience cares for his presence. The good news: audiences have responded very well to Tatum when he stars on comedies, and *Roofman* is pretty much that. Derek Cianfrance may not be a well known name for audiences, but his presence usually guarantees good quality. And judging by the TIFF's reviews, it's looking promising; it's sitting at a 88% on RT.

- Luca Gudagnino is a well known name in cinephile circles, and his second-to-last film, *Challengers*, was his biggest film with around $96 million. For a drama, the star is important and while Andrew Garfield and Ayo Edebiri have their fans, the real huge star is Julia Roberts; *Ticket to Paradise* made $168 million worldwide (quite great for a rom-com nowadays), and *Leave the World Behind* became the fifth biggest English title on Netflix's history. This should definitely intrigue thriller fans.

#**CONS**

- So *Tron* has grown in popularity... but how much? Mainly asking, because at the end of the day, the previous two *Tron* films were considered box office disappointments. Even though *Legacy* has grown in audience, *Ares* goes of its way to not reference it much; neither director Joseph Kosinski or stars Garrett Hedlund, Olivia Wilde and Cillian Murphy (whose cameo was intended for a villain role in a sequel) are back. Even Jeff Bridges' presence is very limited in the trailers, in contrast to his big role in *Legacy*. 15 years is also quite long to release a follow-up. And yes, the actors are well known... but the one weak spot is its own very own star, Jared Leto. Once respected, his credibility has fallen off in recent years thanks to a lot of critical and financial duds. Not to mention, [sexual misconduct accusations.](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/07/jared-leto-accused-sexual-impropriety)

- While Channing Tatum is a very well known name, his luck in theaters hasn't exactly paid off recently. *Magic Mike's Last Dance* was the lowest in the franchise by a wide margin, *Fly Me to the Moon* was a huge box office disaster, and *Blink Twice* didn't even crack $50 million worldwide. Cianfrance is a respected filmmaker, but his highest grossing film (*Pines*) made only $47 million, which isn't a lot of money. It's also gonna have some comedy competition the following week when *Good Fortune* opens.

- Guadagnino is very popular in cinephile circles, but when it comes to the box office, the results don't really reflect that. *Challengers* made $96 million, but it still lost money due to its budget. The rest of his films haven't fared well; his follow-up to *Challengers*, *Queer*, flopped with just $7 million. In fact, outside *Challengers* and *Call Me By Your Name*, his films usually end with less than $20 million worldwide. Roberts is definitely a huge name, and there should be interest in seeing her in another psychological thriller. But a film like this (where the theme is #MeToo) needs great reviews to stand a chance, and it seems like it was a rare Guadagnino misfire; it's currently sitting at a very weak 51% on RT. That not only could dilute interest, but it could be a sign that word of mouth won't be on its favor.

And here's the past results.

Demographic breakdown of Tron: Ares and Roofman,,Announcements/News/Release Info
"""Roofman"" (2025) is super entertaining but also packed with heart and some real sadness.","BASED ON ACTUAL EVENTS. AND TERRIBLE DECISIONS. 

Director Derek Cianfrance is a filmmaker who dives into stories about well-meaning people making poor choices. His characters often walk the line of criminality—smart, clever, and skilled at deception—while also knowing how important it is to avoid violence. If you had one of these characters as a neighbor, you'd probably think highly of them. Take the character in ""Roofman,"" for example, who believes that breaking and entering, with a sprinkle of kidnapping, is the best way to provide for his family and loved ones. His relationships are in shambles, and to truly fix them, he needs to grow up and try a different approach. He sees normal behavior as beneath him, fearing that if he gets stuck in it, he’ll just fade away. He has the opportunity to break free and find happiness, but greed, emotions, or plain old foolishness always seem to trip him up. Cianfrance has delivered some very good films like ""Blue Valentine"" and ""The Place Beyond the Pines,"" and now with ""Roofman"" living up to that standard.

With a lighter vibe than much of his previous work, it’s fun to watch our lovable, albeit clueless hero try to mend his relationship and reconnect with his kids, especially his young daughter. If his family won’t take him back, he’s determined to prove himself. He has a knack for observation and creativity that helps him devise clever ways to steal or escape. Throughout his journey, we see him recognize and sharpen his unique skills. The fun part for us is watching how he navigates various situations. We’re right there with him, brought to life by Channing Tatum, who gives life and heart to the role. The tough part is knowing that eventually, things are bound to go wrong, and we’re left anticipating that moment. That’s when the sadness creeps in, revealing a character who wears a mask of happiness and confidence but consistently drags those around him down.

Be sure to stay for the credits. I had no idea about any of this when I began watching the movie.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

Roofman was.....mid?,"Consider myself a ""fan"" of Cianfrance (Pines was my favorite film in hs, Blue Valentine is great, Light Between Oceans is a step above average period pieces and very affecting) so I was anticipating Roofman highly...but I left feeling like it was your run-of-the-mill average ""based on a true story"" mainstream forgettable  movie...

...his other three were so memorable, even if you found them bad there is so much to get out of them but this was sort of soulless...

...it's been years since his last movie why come back with this? is it a passion project? he just became obsessed and had to tell this story? or was it for the check?(which I find hard to believe because I doubt this type of movie will perform well at the box office)...

...so what do y'all say, have you seen it? did it feel like a large step down in quality from what you expect from Cianfrance? and wtf went wrong? or am I wrong and it's great? idek just flabbergasted at this movie. it wasn't terrible just awfully mid.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

2026 Oscar Predictions - November Edition,"There has been quite a few interesting developments since my last prediction in September. Mainly being the hit to Wicked's stock and Frankenstein overperforming. I look forward to watching the remainder of contenders in December and January to get some more insight

**Best Picture:**

1. One Battle After Another
2. Hamnet
3. Sentimental Value
4. Sinners
5. Marty Supreme
6. Frankenstein
7. It Was Just an Accident
8. Jay Kelly
9. Wicked: For Good
10. Avatar: Fire and Ash

It really looks like OBAA is going to have a dominant sweep. Hamnet has had a recent decline in reviews and I don't think SV or Sinners have much of a chance. The response to Jay Kelly seems to be improving so I feel ok about it for now. I'm open to dropping Wicked but I haven't seen the film yet. Part 1 was a huge hit with the industry and this one will make a ton of money with audiences not rejecting it

**Best Director:** 

1. Paul Thomas Anderson - One Battle After Another
2. Chloe Zhao - Hamnet
3. Jafar Panahi - It Was Just an Accident
4. Joachim Trier - Sentimental Value
5. Josh Safdie - Marty Supreme

PTA should sweep but this is a difficult category to fill out. Coogler, GdT, Park Chan-wook are strong alternatives. I feel good about Panahi being the ""longtime respected international director"" slot but I'm not sure about 4 and 5

**Best Actor:**

1. Timothee Chalamet - Marty Supreme
2. Leonardo DiCaprio - One Battle After Another
3. Ethan Hawke - Blue Moon
4. Wagner Moura - The Secret Agent
5. George Clooney - Jay Kelly

I'm starting to feel really good about Leo winning but I'll keep Timmy for now since i haven't seen Marty Supreme and have had him winning for a long time. I think Leo could easily win BAFTA and has a strong shot at SAG and GG. Ethan Hawke was tremendous in Blue Moon but a solo win like that seems to be a thing of the past. Plemons is an interesting option but I feel like the industry won't be that high on Bugonia. MBJ will have to be considered if he gets into GG, CC, SAG and BAFTA longlist

**Best Actress:** 

1. Jessie Buckley - Hamnet
2. Renate Reinsve - Sentimental Value
3. Amanda Seyfried - The Testament of Ann Lee
4. Rose Byrne - If I Had Legs I'd Kick You
5. Chase Infiniti - One Battle After Another

Looks like Buckley has this sewn up. I find the last 2 spots of this category to be very difficult. I don't think Stone will get in because I don't anticipate Bugonia being a big hit. I didn't find her performance to be especially impressive by her standards and I think there could be some fatigue with voters seeing her almost exclusively in Yorgos movies. After seeing IIHLIKY I can see Byrne as a textbook example of film twitter hopediction. A24 will be pushing her well and maybe she can win GG and some big critic prizes though. Infiniti does not give a lead acting nomination performance but fuck it, OBAA is going to be huge and it's often exciting to nominate a debut role.

**Best Supporting Actor:**

1. Stellan Skarsgard - Sentimental Value
2. Sean Penn - One Battle After Another
3. Paul Mescal - Hamnet
4. Benicio del Toro - One Battle After Another
5. Adam Sandler - Jay Kelly

Penn could start off strong with CC and some big critic prizes but I think Skarsgard will prevail in the end. Even with Frankenstein's strength I think Elordi could just be a critics pick and Sandler will get in as a veteran who has been proving himself recently

**Best Supporting Actress:**

1. Teyana Taylor - One Battle After Another
2. Ariana Grande - Wicked: For Good
3. Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas - Sentimental Value
4. Gwyneth Paltrow - Marty Supreme
5. Amy Madigan - Weapons

I really don't see Taylor's performance as being an Oscar winner but I think that's the way it's heading. I didn't have Madigan in for a while but I really see a route of her winning CC and getting into 1-2 more precursors

**Best Original Screenplay:**

1. Sentimental Value
2. Sinners
3. Marty Supreme 
4. It Was Just an Accident
5. Jay Kelly

This is potentially a very divided and close race between the first 4. I was thinking about IWJAA winning but after the seeing the film I feel doubtful. I don't know if that film will play very well with the Academy at large 

**Best Adapted Screenplay:**

1. One Battle After Another

my november predictions,"contenders iÕve seen: ballad of a small player, bugonia, captain america: brave new world, colorful stage! the movie: a miku who canÕt sing, die my love, elio, frankenstein, hamnet, a house of dynamite, it was just an accident, kpop demon hunters, lilo &amp; stitch, little amlie, a minecraft movie, no other choice, one battle after another, the perfect neighbour, rental family, resurrection, roofman, sinners, sorry baby, superman, thunderbolts*, together, the twits, wake up dead man, weapons, wicked: for good, wolf man

iÕll also note that iÕm seeing blue moon in an hour and a half so maybe thatÕll change some of my predictions

hereÕs my explanations:

picture:

canÕt deny that those wicked: for good reactions were concerning, but i honestly donÕt think they mean that much. it was always aiming for the populist blockbuster slot, so as long as it does well at the box-office and audiences love it itÕs fine. both of those things are happening, so iÕm leaving it in. plus i canÕt justify removing it from any other category or it missing picture with a package this strong. iÕve put ann lee in, since searchlight is now campaigning for it. it might be weird and divisive, but so was emilia prez. hate to remove bugonia but it just doesnÕt seem quite strong enough to get in unfortunately. iÕm starting to worry about jay kelly crashing an otherwise great lineup, but iÕll wait for the reactions when itÕs out on netflix before i do anything drastic. bottom 5 are basically random, i doubt we get anything outside of this top 15

director:

iÕm not budging on pcw under any circumstances, and anderson, zhao, and panahi all feel like locks. the 5th slot is very difficult, thereÕs so many movies where missing just feels wrong. i ended up going with del toro since he has netflix behind him, but iÕm prepared to be wrong. wasnÕt sure what to do with the 10th slot, since the 10th film in my picture lineup is clearly not a director player, but train dreams probably feels the most likely of the films i have near picture

actor:

iÕm so desperate for lee byung-hun to win, i know itÕs a hopediction but he really just deserves it that much. i had marty supreme going drama at the globes, but now that itÕs confirmed comedy thereÕs no reason to doubt moura here. iÕm not gonna say ethan hawke isnÕt happening, but i donÕt really see any reason to predict him at the moment when the category is this strong. iÕm abour to see blue moon, so maybe thatÕll change my mind. is it just me or is oscar isaac being kinda underestimated?

actress:

buckley is clearly unbeatable

buckley is clearly unbeatable. seyfried and erivo are pushing their films into best picture, so iÕm not losing confidence them unless i stop believing in the films completely. torn between stone and infiniti for the 5th slot, but went with stone since i canÕt see plemons getting in without her. maybe tessa thompson surprises here, iÕm not taking the cca shortlists too seriously but hedda did show up a lot so maybe weÕre underestimating it. would love it if lawrence had a shot, but i donÕt see it

supporting actor:

insanely strong lineup this year, feels like any of the top 4 could end up taking it. with that being said, i struggle to see why theyÕd go for penn. he has 2 oscars already, doesnÕt care about campaigning much, and is a fairly controversial guy. it feels more like skarsgrd vs. mescal, with elordi having a chance of overperforming. i feel like one of the sinners actors is getting in here, and caton has the stronger performance and seems to be getting the bigger push. del toro is great, but i just canÕt see him getting enough #1 votes

supporting actress:

i know glenn close is an unusual pick here, and iÕm prepared to be wrong, but this race is really giving 2022 to me. our main options are an extremely strong performance in a slightly underwhelming sequel to a beloved blockbuster, and a great performance in the picture frontrunner that doesnÕt leave as strong of an impression as the filmÕs performances in the other categories. and in that race, they ended up choosing the performance from an overdue veteran that theyÕve never gotten the chance to award before. obviously this is a completely different situation in many ways, but i just suspect it will end similarly, since i struggle to see any of the frontrunners taking it. iÕve put in aÕzion partially because iÕm not sure about the other contenders and partially because i donÕt have marty supreme getting enough nominations. maybe infiniti sneaks in here a la lakeith stanfield?

casting:

tough race between sinners and obaa, but since i have caton getting in and infiniti missing, sinners makes more sense. going with the long-shot of iwjaa, which has an incredibly strong ensemble of first-time actors and would be a very inspired nomination. we still donÕt know how this category works but hopefully theyÕre cool enough to go for stuff like superman

original screenplay:

the 5th slot is so hard. can someone whoÕs seen ann lee tell me what the screenplay is like? musicals often donÕt get screenplay nominations unless theyÕre really strong, is the writing good enough? iÕm going with jay kelly for now because it feels weird for it to blank completely, but would love it if sorry baby could surprise here. i have iwjaa winning just because itÕs their only real opportunity to award panahi (international feature doesnÕt go to the director), and i imagine theyÕd want to give him something

adapted screenplay:

iÕm so desperate to hopedict no other choice winning here but even i know thatÕs too far. the top 6 all feel super strong to me, their packages just wouldnÕt make sense without screenplay. i guess frankenstein is probably the weakest link, but it still doesnÕt feel right for it to miss. how are you people making room for train dreams?

cinematography:

iÕm still just as confused here as i was a month ago. brutally strong lineup. sinners missing is a wild prediction but it just feels like the kind of movie to unexpectedly miss a couple of techs, if that makes sense. resurrection would be such a good nom, hoping it can get into the shortlist so it has a shot

editing:

this category never does anything interesting, iÕve got nothing to say here. they better not snub noc

sound:

why do people think f1 can win here? itÕs not the kind of thing they award at all, they always go for picture players. and this year has so many picture players that fit into this category! i know they normally have at least one below-the-line player that sneaks in, but in my mind thatÕs avatar, which i do not buy in picture at all. in my mind, if f1 gets in, but it would be more of a dead reckoning/the creator-style nom

visual effects:

kind of an unusual lineup, but these techs with shortlists usually give us one or two surprises. frankenstein is a strong contender, but it doesnÕt have amazing vfx and the competition is strong, and it would feel weird to leave f1 out of sound and keep it here. how to train your dragon is being underestimated, i know we all hate live-action remakes but itÕs very cgi-heavy and a big financial success with great reviews from audiences and positive reviews from critics, plus everyone i know who works in the film industry has been glazing it like crazy. it just doesnÕt feel like something that would miss here. i find it weird how everyoneÕs ignoring mickey 17 here, the reviews might not have been parasite-level but they werenÕt bad at all and the vfx were great. canÕt wait until the electric state to get shortlisted and everyone says they forgot it came out this year

makeup:

iÕve been holding onto wolf man for a while since i was very impressed with the makeup, but i just canÕt see them nominating 3 horror movies. this branch historically has a lot of genre bias, i know two got in last year but that was the first time any horror got in since 2010. and itÕs so hard to fill the 5th slot with something thatÕs not horror! i went with superman, but im not even confident that will make the shortlist tbh. iÕve heard the makeup in blue moon is bad so i didnÕt choose it, but maybe i was misinformed and iÕll change my mind after seeing it. intrigued by kokuho since it got onto the cca shortlist despite being a foreign film with no buzz. not sure what the makeup is like, but maybe that suggests itÕs strong?

costume design:

i dont really think anything is locked, but itÕs hard to see a different line-up happening imo. maybe hedda gets in if its stronger than we think, but iÕm not gonna overreact to the criticsÕ choice shortlists. i feel like iÕm the only person who recently switched to wicked, but after seeing it i was even more impressed with the costumes than the first one.

production design:

also seems like a pretty clear lineup, maybe ann lee gets in but i havenÕt seen anything to suggest the production design is that strong

international feature:

this branch never goes with the obvious 5, but itÕs hard to see any of these missing. hind rajab is definitely the most vulnerable, but even though thereÕs a lot of strong options here, nothing really feels strong enough to justify replacing it. thereÕs so many movies iÕm looking out for, to the point that i did a top 15 instead of a top 10, but i just canÕt make space for them

documentary feature:

the perfect neighbour is exactly the kind of thing they snub here, iÕm not buying it at all. was holding out hope for andr is an idiot but it wasnÕt even on the list of eligible films so i guess thatÕs out. i havenÕt put that much thought into most of my choices here, nobody really knows what theyÕre doing with this category anyway

animated feature:

why would they not submit ne zha 2???? this 5th slot is impossible to fill, elio so clearly has everything working against it but thereÕs just no other options. iÕm at the point where iÕm considering just going crazy and actually putting the miku movie in (in a just world it would sweep). 

score:

iÕve kinda run out of steam at this point writing this. these are pretty normal score predictions, thereÕs nothing crazy here that warrants an explanation. idk iÕve got nothing to say

song:

couldnÕt fit in the post because iÕm limited to 20 images, iÕll put in the comments when this gets approved. i need something from the miku movie to get shortlisted here so bad. Òsalt then sour then sweetÓ feels like the kind of out-of-nowhere pick this branch likes",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
Tarkovsky reference in Bugonia,"I wasnÕt able to find the exact still where TeddyÕs mother starts floating out of the bathtub, but the second I saw the reference I got a chill, because it works so well as a reference!

My interpretation of the original shot is that it communicates how protagonistÕs mother has become an ÇelevatedÈ, super-human, almost metaphysical presence in the protagonistÕs life, to the degree that all his future relationships become attempts at re-creating that original dynamic between himself and his mother. In his imaginations of her, he creates a being that can literally defy gravity.

In Bugonia, I think the reference works first on a surface level. Teddy is a clearly a character with mommy-issues, and itÕs referencing another film about a character with similar issues. But on a deeper level, TeddyÕs dynamic with his mother fundamentally similarly shapes how he relates to the people and world around him, and in a way thatÕs central to the film. I think itÕs clear that TeddyÕs fight against the system in service of the planet, is really a fight to save his mother, and in his mind thereÕs no distinction between to two (or at least the line become jumbled to in his mind). 

To me, the moment TeddyÕs mum begins to levitate in the bathtub is also the moment she takes on a greater metaphysical presence in TeddyÕs life, and thatÕs why I think itÕs a damn good reference.

In Bugonia (2025) bees never spontaneously generate out of the carcass of a cow or bull. This is because the director (Yorgos Lanthimos) has no respect for their audiences knowledge on Ancient Mediterranean folk practices,No respect for the audience ,Plot/Story/Interpretation/Analysis
I appreciate these unique ideas for Indian movies on Netflix,"Haven't seen Cargo or Humans in the loop yet, I end up watching Frankenstein or Bugonia or the more, urgent, new movie/ show that gets released whenever I get the time. I did see Brahman Naman a few years ago, but I don't remember it anymore, except that it made me sad and laugh at the same time. I just found out about the other two films yesterday. 

They didn't get the most stellar reviews as far as I know when it came to execution, but it's cool to see movies in India trying more sci-fi and AI related concepts with these social themes in a different genre. And I will gladly watch anything with Vikrant Massey and Shwetha Tripathi in anything. 

Does anyone have any other movie like these they can recommend, that go under the radar so to speak?

WhatÕs the strongest contender you think could miss the OscarÕs this year?,"There are obviously some movies that are locks at this point (OBAA, Hamnet) and some that are only maybe competitive in one or two categories (Springsteen at this point) but usually there seems to be some movie predicted to make it in in a number of categories and walks away empty handed. Last year we had Challengers which was predicted to be competitive in score, song, editing, screen play, and even potentially BP. 

So which films do you think have a chance to surprise by missing out on nominations completely. For me I think Bugonia and/or Jay Kelly seem to have the best chance but I want to hear from some people who know more about trends or have seen more of the films to get a feel. ",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
Anyone else ready to do something drastic for Half Life 3?,,Memes/Jokes/Humor/Satire
Theory for Michelle,"Just finished the movie and I had a very distinct impression about Michelle the whole movie, but I have some points to back up my theory so here we go.

From the beginning we're introduced to Michelle as this very robotic, a bit awkward, kind of CEO who is running her ship too tight. She's attempting to put bandaids on gushing wounds and her damage control isn't working. She's also a perfectionist and wrapped in intense privilege with her position.  

My theory is that Michelle never believed in humanity and because of this their end became inevitable through her own actions. She was not making a bipartisan assessment and experimentation of the species, but rather pushing for their destruction all along. 

From Teddy's point of view we can see one of the worst case scenarios of what Michelle's company has done to humanity. We can also see this when, at the end of the movie, her brethren on the ship tell her the other experiments have pretty much all failed. 

Looking a little deeper, I remember her comment about bees at the dinner table. How she admires them because they don't complain, they aren't pious or self righteous, and they work for the collective cause. This reflects back to her leadership at the company and how she has failed her human worker bees, but believes it is their own fault. Michelle has shown, from the viewers perspective, that she lacks fundamental empathy for humans. 

The reason I believe my last statement is because when she is speaking to her assistant about letting people leave at 5:30 pm for the day, she goes back and forth in a very artificial way to make it clear that despite the setbacks on worker's rights, she expects them to still get the unreasonable workload done without complaint. It is very reflective of how human CEO's are and how Michelle has herself devolved into a more ruthless and selfish version of her personality (stated towards the end of the movie). 

A small tidbit I also want to add is that I think Michelle enjoyed her position above humans and wanted to maintain it while making sure the experiments still failed. This is evident by her strict routines in the beginning of the movie. If she is an alien with access to alien technology, why would she be so hyper focused on her aesthetics in such a primitive way if not for the enjoyment of playing her character? Like an actor in a play. 

When she is explaining history to Teddy she smiles a bit when she explains that humans used to worship her people, and then shows anger when explaining how humans devolved and destroyed one another. Never once does she seem to accept her species responsibility in leading to these events nor does she seem remorseful about humans plighted existence from the beginning. No, she only shows sympathy for her Emperor and his poor decision making. 

In a way her character very much reminds me of a reflection of the idea of Lucifer, except in this story Lucifer wins. 

That's all I've got ??????

Edit: I just remembered too when Michelle is lying to Teddy about why the bees are dying it seems to infer that her company is purposefully killing the bees, which would lead to the direct destruction of the human race. Her rhetoric to him is the same rhetoric used by real companies who are absolutely lying and doing the destruction they claim they aren't doing. 


",Plot/Story/Interpretation/Analysis
I think Bugonia can be a test, if you empathize more with Michelle you're a purist neolib and if you empathize more with Teddy you distrust institutions and CEOs and accept human messiness. Think of your reaction when teddy slapped michelle before and after knowing she's a alien. personally him slapping the alien is a extatic moment; remember SHE KILLED ALL OF HUMANITY ,Plot/Story/Interpretation/Analysis

What is Bugonia really about?,"Bugonia, which seems to have quite the variety of interpretations with its artistic production only has one real meaning. This movie is produced as a sort of inside joke referencing Emma Stone's desire to cut shave her head, as she prefers it, and finally getting her to admit doing so makes her appear like an alien to some of her close friends in real life. This movie is a gag and parody that is made with a high quality production and cast all to joke about Emma cutting her hair. Personally I think it is a beautiful movie as I can see the fun the actors had creating this film and the intricate humor layered in the script and acting.

Bugonia (2025) Review: Emma Stone &amp; Jesse Plemons in LanthimosÕ Wildest ...,,Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
What are your thoughts about Bugonia (2025)?,,Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
Watched Bugonia (2025) and it was weird...,"*""You can't beat me because you are a loser and I'm a winner and that's fucking life!"" - Michelle, Bugonia*

I just finished Bugonia and honestly, IÕm still a little conflicted about it, in a very Yorgos Lanthimos way. One thing that stood out immediately was the unusual 1.50:1 aspect ratio, which IÕve basically never seen used for a streaming release. The black sidebars made most my screen feel dead, but at the same time the film probably wouldÕve looked even stranger stretched out to a standard 1.78:1 release.

What I enjoyed was the look and feel of the movie. The bright colors, odd designs, abstract sets, and alien environments all felt like classic Yorgos imagination. Some of the frame compositions were genuinely beautiful. The score mostly stays in the background, occasionally stepping forward to sharpen the tension, though I honestly found it weaker than composer's work in Poor Things.

Emma Stone delivers, and Jesse Plemons is doing career best stuff right now. This might even be his strongest performance yet. And yes, the hype about Emma shaving her head for the role didnÕt go much to waste as I thought, she delivered.

One of my favorite parts of the movie was the mental-chess dynamic between Teddy and Michelle. Teddy keeps pushing, adjusting his approach, cornering her psychologically in small, while Michelle is trying to stay three steps ahead, even though she knows Teddy is circling closer and closer to the truth. Their back-and-forth feels like a game without rules, but with real stakes. ItÕs subtle but interesting to watch. I also liked the ""Save the Green Planet!"" theme, this feels like Yorgos' own take on it.

The final reveal was exactly the kind of thing I expected from Yorgos, something bizarre, mythic, and strangely funny.

What IÕm stuck on is the rating. I floated between 3.5 and 4 the whole time. I liked it a lot, even admired parts of it, but I didnÕt love it the way I thought I'd do.

**Rating:** 4/5 (but honestly feels like a 3.75 to me)",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

The moral or political message behind Bugonia?,"I love how EmmaÕs character probes the various possible causes of CCD with Teddy and makes it very apparent that it can be due to other vectors unrelated to pesticides.

This is the actual ÔmiscommunicationÕ weÕre witnessing in the film imo. Whether itÕs pesticides or something else, Bugonia wants us to see ourselves in Teddy. Fiercely appealing to hierarchy in assigning blame for whatever societal or personal ill we are experiencing. Be it a tech CEO, an Alien or a God, we never seek an answer which could be an ÔamalgamationÕ of misunderstood lower level factors but that we demand a singular vector through which to filter our wrath and frustration.

We always seek to understand those above us in the hierarchy but it is NEVER in reverse. In the same way that the Aliens tried to ÔguideÕ and preserve life to some extent in a ÒglobalÓ sense, they cannot understand the actual nuances of what our needs are nor do they care (TeddyÕs mother). We can no more understand a tech CEO or a God than a Bee colony can understand Teddy's motives as a bee keeper.

I feel like the biggest statement this film makes is that blame seeking, EVEN IF you are completely right about your intuitions never results in a good solution. ItÕll always end up as antifreeze in our veins. We as a society will always seek to blame and find restitution in higher powers / entities which cannot understand our grievances nor do they care about our individual suffering.",Plot/Story/Interpretation/Analysis
Can Bugonia win Best Picture?,"Just watched on VOD and really liked it. IÕm curious on why some people are even counting it out of the BP lineup. Also Emma is insaneÉ with Poor Things/The Favourite history, i donÕt think it would be crazy to imagine Bugonia snatching the Anora packageÉ

Bugonia really embraces the conspiracy rabbit hole.,"First off, id like to say this movie was absolutely amazing. I dont have a single negative thing to say about it. I searched conspiracy for some fun posts about it, but didnt really find anything to chew on. 
Theres a few blink and youll miss it conspiracies plastered throughout, but mostly towards the end.

Particularly that the earth was flat and that our version of space does not exist. Much like Eddie Bravo and other really in too far conspiracy theorists have said for years now. I think this is a really fun discussion, and would like to engage with actual conspiracy theorists here that believe in flat earth and no space theory. How closely did this movie get to these theories? What was the same and different? 

Ive also been an ancient astronaut theorist since i was like 16. And this also played into that. 

Anyway, super good movie, and id love to discuss any thoughts on its conspiratorial subject matter. 

Side note: Really well done in the woke/not woke/normal movie regard. I feel like it pleases both sides without pissing them off. This is what movies are supposed to be like when they have political messaging in them. Dont alienate half your audience (pun intended).",Plot/Story/Interpretation/Analysis
"98th Oscars - Above the Line Category Predictions (Post-Wicked, Pre Globes and CCA)","**BEST PICTURE**

Before we delve into CCA and Globe noms, I still feel comfortable with OBAA as our frontrunner with Hamnet and Sinners as my spoilers, 4-7 seem like solid bets. LetÕs talk Wicked since itÕs not the lock I thought pre-embargo, with reviews being less enthusiastic overall, thereÕs a valid argument about it missing the 10. IÕll keep it in purely off of box office, crafts and Erivo &amp; Grande for but I would have it in the 8-12 range. No Other Choice stays in and rounding out my 10, I have The Testament of Ann Lee off of Seyfried and techs.



**DIRECTING**

I still have PTA winning even if One Battle doesnÕt take Picture, I feel confident about Zhao and Panahi, with the last 2 slots being a shuffle of Coogler, Safdie and Trier. With how Sinners is positioned, I feel comfortable about Coogler placing but not locked by any means. Other contenders that are dark horses for noms I think include Guillermo del Toro, Mona Fastvold and Kleber Mendona Filho.



**LEAD ACTRESS**

As of late, this category has boiled down to Buckley winning with spots 2-5 up for grabs. Reinsve seems solid for the nom, same applies for Seyfried. LetÕs talk about Cynthia Erivo, before the embargo, I moved her up to number 2 viewing her as a possible dark horse to Buckley, now I think sheÕs fighting for a spot. IÕll keep her in for now since I still have Wicked in my Picture lineup but if it falls out or she loses the Globe to either Seyfried or Byrne, she could miss to Chase Infiniti or even Emma Stone. Unless Song Sung Blue is like Nyad, HudsonÕs ainÕt happening.



**LEAD ACTOR**

I donÕt have as much to say on this category. With Marty Supreme continuing to warm up in reactions, I still have Chalamet taking it with DiCaprio as my alternative based on his filmÕs strength. HawkeÕs looking solid for the nomination, I wonÕt rule him out as a potential threat but only if Blue Moon overperforms, feel comfortable about Moura and Jordan. Other contenders I wonÕt rule out would be Clooney, Byung-hun, Plemons or Edgerton.



**SUPPORTING ACTRESS**

This category gives me an aneurysm. I think Grande could win based on what sheÕs doing (plus a little category fraud doesnÕt hurt) but only if Wicked stays in Picture. Moving Teyana Taylor to the top is not something I feel confident in but I have her as One BattleÕs acting win, with the comparisons to Mahershala Ali in Moonlight compelling me for now. If I had my way, Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas would be our front runner with how open this field is, anyone could take it, hell I wonÕt rule out Amy Madigan or even Glenn Close at this rate.



**SUPPORTING ACTOR**

Of the 4 acting categories, I have the least to say. Mescal, Penn and Skarsgrd are your locks dooking it out for the win, with the remaining spots being a shuffle of del Toro, Elordi and Sandler. IÕll lean Benicio based on him coattailing Penn and being the character audiences respond to the most, and Elordi with the amount of mentions heÕs gotten but if Jay Kelly returned into my Picture 10, Sandler could take his spot.



**ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY**

For now, I have Sinners winning as CooglerÕs consolation prize although Sentimental Value and It Was Just an Accident are in the mix. Marty Supreme is looking pretty good for the nomination, and rounding out my 5 is Jay Kelly as itÕs lone nom but IÕll acknowledge it could very easily be a Best Picture staple. Please nominate Sorry, Baby and I wonÕt shut up for months but other possibilities aside from that would probably be Testament of Ann Lee, The Secret Agent, Blue Moon and maybe Weapons or Is This Thing On? but weÕll see.



**ADAPTED SCREENPLAY**

One Battle and Hamnet are locked with the other three spots looking up for grabs. Since I have No Other Choice in Picture, this checks out here, IÕll keep on Bugonia for now but it's nowhere near a lock here and my one hot take is Wake Up Dead Man misses out for Train Dreams as its lone nomination. Bentley and Kwedar are fresh off nominations for Sing Sing last year and if Netflix campaigns it right, that could play a factor here. Frankenstein is an outside shot but the only ATL shot it looks good for would be Supporting Actor, I donÕt see Wicked happening and if you would like to entertain NEON revives Life of Chuck here, let me know below.

Bugonia Light Fixture,"The construction lights in the first scene is moved when viewing the ""baby monitor"" in the second scene.",Plot/Story/Interpretation/Analysis
"Watched it again a second time, but this time without subtitles during the ""ending"" scene and I think it works out so much better","I watched in theaters the day it came out and I enjoyed it. 

I then wanted to watch it again but my local theater said it performed poorly and no one was buying tickets so they got rid of it to make way for Running Man and Wicked so I waited until today since it was just released on streaming.

Anyways, I watch it today without the subtitles on and during the scene towards the end when she is back on her mothership with her kind there were no subtitles at all and honestly I prefer it that way. With the subtitles on all she and her kind discuss are how they couldn't reach her since she didn't have hair anymore and that a decision must be made in regards to the humans fate. 

Since I didn't watch it with subtitles tonight I forgot what they originally said and I think it plays so much better. They talk in their language and she is upset and ultimately takes that pointy chopstick/wand thing and pops the earths bubble and all humans die.

The dialogue she and her kind have are not 100% vital to understanding what happens next and how the film ends. I think it plays much, much better this way.",Plot/Story/Interpretation/Analysis
Interesting listing in Canada,The advertised basement from this listing reminded me so much of Bugonia I had to share it here,Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
"Hot Take: We have a lot of amazing movies come out for the past eleven years, the reason why this year was such a horrid year for film is because no one went out and saw them!","The only problem is that (aside from Sinners, 28 Years Later, Superman, and Weapons) barely any people had time to see Black Bag, Bugonia,  The Smashing Machine, Kiss of the Spider Woman, Roofman, Companion, Novicaine, Mickey 17, One Battle After Another, etc. As a result, we let films like Lilo &amp; Stitch, Jurassic World Dominion, and A Minecraft Movie become hits. While a lot of people don't care about box office results, the truth is that if you want to see more of these movies, vote with your wallet, and if anyone wants to have a long, vital career as a filmmaker, the film in question has to become a certified box office hit.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
Predicting AFI top 10 and NBR Best Picture lineups,"I am currently sick and therefore have too much time on my hands, so here is my predictions for these two groups.

**AFI Top 10**

- Avatar: Fire and Ash
- Bugonia
- Frankenstein
- Hamnet
- Marty Supreme
- One Battle After Another
- Sentimental Value
- Sinners
- Train Dreams
- Weapons

Commentary: Weapons is giving a A Quiet Plave where it performs really here and gets like a PGA nomination. They nominated Emilia Perez because of Zoe Saldana and Selena Gomez, so I assume Sentimental Value gets in here because of Elle Fanning. 

Alternate pick is probably Jay Kelly. My prediction is that Wicked *will* miss here and that will wake the last people up to the reality that this is vulnerable in Best Picture.

...

**National Board of Review**

- WINNER: One Battle After Another

Top 10
- Frankenstein
- Hamnet
- A House of Dynamite
- Is This Thing On?
- Jay Kelly
- Marty Supreme
- No Other Choice
- Sinners
- Train Dreams
- Wicked: For Good

Commentary: Who knows with this group. Last year they had their worst Oscar overlap ever with only four films crossing over to Best Picture from their 11 mentions. As an Oscar precursor this group means truly nothing. I am just having fun here and throwing darts.

OBAA fits very well with their past winners: a big budget action film, Warner Bros and a well-known director they've actually rewarded before. Sinners would be my strong alternative pick.

Regarding noms, A House of Dynamite just feels like something they would do given their tastes. Sometimes they throw in random indies here, hence my Is This Thing On? mention. They do NOT like International films, the only ones that got nominated from recent years are The Boy and the Heron and RRR. So against my better judgement I'm going with No Other Choice.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

I've seen it once already, but I really wanted another watch on the big screen. 

How often do you find yourself rebooking?

I think Dune: Part 2 is my most repeated so far in theaters with 4. 

So far this year for me:
One Battle After Another x 2
Nosferatu x 2
Sinners x 2
28 Years Later x 2

\- *I Lied To You (from Sinners) (Runner Up)*

\- Last Time (I Seen the Sun) (from Sinners)

\- Dear Me (from Diane Warren: Relentless)

First things first, leading the pack are:

\- One Battle After Another (13 Nominations and 7 Wins: including Best Picture)

\- Sinners (15 Nominations and 4 Wins: including Best Original Screenplay)

\- Hamnet (11 Nominations and 1 Win: Best Actress)

\- and Frankenstein (9 nominations and 3 Wins: mainly a technical player).

I know I've got a hot take or two in there, mainly Marty Supreme only recieving six nominations (missing Director, and having Timmy's widely predicted win go to Leo instead), but that's primarily because I'm still waiting to see how the wider critical and audience reception pans out. Due to it's current buzz based on reported screenings it has the potential to be a major contender (hence, my placement of it in Picture, Screenplay, and as the Alternate Pick in Lead Actor) but I still think it's a bit early to have it winning any major prizes. Come December however, this could very easily change.

Currently, I just don't see it winning anything major due to the sheer strength of not just One Battle After Another, but Sinners.

I've viewed both films on two occasions throughout the year, and strongly believe that aside from Hamnet, they will be this year's primary contenders: with Warner Bros pushing OBAA in ATL categories to synergise with PTA's narrative and its status as the BP frontrunner, and pushing Sinners in BTL categories to capitalise on its technical aspects, in addition to Original Screenplay, to increase Coogler's chances of an Oscar win.

Additionally, I have the trio of OBAA, Hamnet and Sinners dominating the Acting Categories. Having recently rewatched Sinners, I believe it makes more sense for Warner Bros to give more of a balanced push to both film's performances, rather than going all in for the unlikely chance of OBAA recieving a record breaking 6 nominations ([which I speculated upon the other day](https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/1p45l6n/could_one_battle_after_another_do_the_thing/)). Therefore, I have Mosaku and Lindo in the slots I previously had predicted for Hall and Del Toro, as much as I love the latter two.

It's simply more balanced and logical. As many of you pointed out, while Hall and Del Toro's performances are strong, they are relatively brief and a little one-note. After rewatching Sinners yesterday, I feel that Mosaku and Lindo's performances have better nomination chances: not only do they have more screentime, but I feel their film provides stronger showcases of their acting ability than OBAA does for Hall and Del Toro.

Now onto the Acting Winners and Song before I wrap things up. Like I said, I'm not putting all my faith in Marty until I've seen it, or the film's wide reviews are released. Therefore, I have Leonardo winning his second Best Actor Oscar, with Chalamet in second place, although Chalamet may gain the push he needs if Marty's buzz is strong enough come December. (Emphasis on may, as I strongly believe OBAA's momentum could bring Leo over the line regardless, it's just that strong). Similarly, due to Wicked's middling reception (for an awards contendor) combined with the sequel curse, I have Teyana Taylor as the Supporting Actress frontrunner. Her screentime is short for a win contendor, but it's looking like a Mahershala Ali in Moonlight situation to me.

In all, I believe OBAA is just too strong to go home empty handed in the Acting Categories, so Leo or Teyana winning (if not both of them) is just a no-brainer. I don't Chase Infiniti winning BA against Jessie Buckley, and Stellan Skarsgard's overdue narrative is honestly too good to pass up: as a matter of fact, I believe his biggest threat is Paul Mescal rather than Sean Penn (due to Hamnet's strength and Penn's two previous wins), so I may move Penn to 3rd and Mescal to 2nd in the future).

Finally, song is the most interesting category to me. Whilst I have Golden at number one, as a Let it Go type winner, it could certianly be overtaken by I Lied to You based on how much the Academy loves Sinners. Honestly? I wouldn't be mad either way. I love both songs, and to be honest, the best case scenario in this category for me personally (while it's unlikely) is a tie between the two. I don't see it happening, but you never know I guess.

I really hope my yapping hasn't bored any of you to death, or broken any rules this place might have about overlong posts. Do tell me what you think, and as this is my first predictions, I'm very open to criticism. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

My First/Final 83rd Golden Globe Nomination Predictions (November 2025),"Predictions may tend to change.

Recently following my 98th Oscar predictions not long ago, I was hoping to share my first 83rd Golden Globe predictions for 2026 (I will not be making another prediction post for both Oscars and Golden Globes for about three weeks after this one to comply with community rules). With the 83rd Golden Globe nominations announcement nearing on December 8, 2025, which would be almost two weeks from now, I would consider these 83rd Golden Globe nomination predictions I'm listing below my first and final predictions before the nominations are announced on December 8th. Like with the Oscars, I have One Battle After Another, Sinners and Hamnet as my frontrunners amongst other strong contenders like Marty Supreme and Sentimental Value, with probably One Battle After Another potentially leading the nominations tally.

In Bugonia (2025) Yorgos Lanthimos makes history by casting sitting US Vice President JD Vance,,Cast Performance/Acting/Actor Discussion
Bugonia and Blue Moon will be available on VOD on Nov 25!,,Promotion/Advertising
I have so much passion for these 2 movies,"They have good costumes and the music is harmonically interesting. That is all these movies have going for them.
The acting is bad and cringe. The plot is bad and long and dumb. The CGI was awful at times. The whole point of these movies were made to have a few moments where you go ""omg! Dorothy, the yellow road, omg tin boy, omg red shoe"". 
A character dies by getting a house cycloned on top of them.
When I think about these movies I want to cause 10s of thousands of dollars of damage to my own property. 
These films brought out a rage inside of me I didn't know was possible. That is how passionate I am about these movies. 
I will be watching Bugonia again to rid myself of this Wicked(:for Good(2025)) ball of hatred.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
Is it normal not to remember characters names from movies you just saw and really enjoyed?,"Last week I saw a movie in theaters called Bugonia.  I really enjoyed it... until the end at least.  But I can't name a single character from the movie.  I can describe them and the plot but I can't name their characters.  Also I can rattle off all the actors and the director.

And a month before that I saw a film I enjoyed even more(One Battle After Another) and I can't name any of the characters from that.

Its really bad... I forgot the character names in the parking lot while I was reflecting upon the film.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

My 98th Oscar Predictions (for 2026; November 2025),"Predictions may tend to change.

With the awards season just beginning with the Gotham Awards to take place in the beginning of December and 98th Oscar shortlists coming mid-December with many industry critics awards announcing all throughout the end of the year and the start of next year, I would love to share my thoughts on the nominations predictions I have in mind. As far as we know, One Battle After Another, Hamnet and Sinners are currently the top three frontrunners (perhaps with Marty Supreme too), but for the time being I've been hoping to share my personal predictions on what films I think will get in. I may be feeling pretty confident that One Battle After Another and Sinners will have the most nominations, but it depends on what the awards season will lead (still rooting for Hamnet, Marty Supreme and Sentimental Value along with the other films in contention).

[TOMT] [Anime] Trailer before Bugonia,"I saw Bugonia in a Cinemark theater in the suburbs of Seattle on Halloween night, and there was a trailer/teaser for an anime that looked pretty cool. However, for the life of me, I cant remember the name. 

I feel like it was maybe a commercial for a new series on Netflix, maybe coming in 2026.  I remember there being a character with long hair (maybe white or wearing a white dress/robe) and a sword. I have some word salad ive associated with the trailer like ninja, demons or vampires, retribution or revenge. Its not the Demon Slayer movie or Scarlet. Any help is appreciated",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

Okay, I know that literally no one on the face of the earth is predicting Yorgos Lanthimos to get into director, let alone for the movie to get into picture. But, I put a lot of thought into this, and I realized, the Academy tends to only nominate 1 director of a foreign film per year, *sometimes* 2. So it's safer not to predict Panahi because it's another foreign film. The reason I snubbed Panahi over Trier is because Sentimental Value has more strength as a film, because it is in contention for 4 acting noms, and a win for screenplay. As for the Wagner Moura snub, I think that the film *The Secret Agent* is not really in contention for anything except Actor and *maybe* Picture and/or screenplay. Whereas Bugonia is likely to get into Picture, Actress, Screenplay, and *probably* Cinematography (hopefully). So it makes more sense that Jesse Plemons could take Moura's slot, which is arguably the most vulnerable. And the reason I predicted a lot of technical wins plus Screenplay for Hamnet over OBAA is because I think that if the Academy goes with OBAA for Picture, Director, and Supporting Actor, they'll want to give Hamnet at least a few things more than just Actress. Anyways, everyone reading this probably deeply disagrees with me, so if you could explain why instead of just simply saying no, that'd be great!",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

I just watched A House of Dynamite and are you actually fucking kidding me with that “ending”?!?!?,,Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
"Just Finished Watching ""A House of Dynamite"". Did They Like... Run Out Of Budget Halfway Through?","Spoilers for A House of Dynamite ahead. I gave ""A House of Dynamite"" a chance as Netflix was boasting it being their 1 movie for the day, and who doesn't love a good movie about the ever present threat of nuclear armageddon? But after spending two hours watching this blue balling collection of scenes packaged as a ""movie"", I am shocked this cut ever made it onto Netflix. So first, I want to say the first half of this is EXCELLENT. Not only does it do a great job of building tension, but I loved the premise of the situation rapidly becoming more and more dire. The idea that even with all our technology and people and protocols, we can still be so helpless is not only terrifying but genuinely thought provoking as well. And if they just stayed and built with that, this probably would have been an easy slam dunk. But then, the second half arrives. We backtrack to roughly all the same events we just saw from the perspective of others involved (between the President and General(?)). Now this is not in itself a bad choice. Different perspectives can be a great opportunity to get new information that makes our understanding of the situation richer, or just to understand more about how those involved are feeling. The problem is, though, we don't get that. Instead, we get a RECAP of what we just saw, with almost the EXACT same dialogue we heard before. And it is ROUGH and boring to bear through. For example, they make us go through the whole motions of waiting to see if the interception worked, even though we saw not even 20 minutes ago it didn't! There's no suspense here, why are we seeing this again?! And for the little bit of extra scene and dialogue added, we're not given anything that makes it worth seeing the events from these different perspectives. This was so bad I had to pause and make sure I didn't somehow rewind to the beginning. It genuinely felt like they took alternative cuts from the first half and slapped them on the second half to make the runtime. And then, the ending. Ohhhh my goood. Now I'm going to get some people here saying this is supposed to be an ambiguous and open ended ending, meant to leave us thinking and feeling hollow. The only problem with this argument is that it's bullshit, because it's just not an ending. If you were reading a book, and I copied and pasted a random line from the middle of my book, and made that the only sentence in the final chapter, would you consider that appropriate? Of course not! You would probably think it's an error or I didn't finish the book! So then, why is it magically allowed here? A House of Dynamite, objectively, does not have an ending. They took a random scene of the soldier collapsing from the first half of the movie, pasted it to the end, added a fade to black, and called it a day. If there was ANYTHING new here, even just a slight extension of what we saw before in this scene, then maybe I could get it a pass. But this is not the case. It's just... nothing. A House of Dynamite, in its current form, is flat out incomplete. It's a draft of a movie. It is 40 minutes of content that acts like it ran out of a budget halfway through, so it just repeats itself with deleted scenes and cuts when it runs out of those. I think what pisses me off so much about this is the potential with its concepts and what it tries to talk about. I love the aura of hopelessness and doom that permeates, and the conflicting ideas from everyone on what to do. There is clearly a great film to be had here, but it just... isn't here man. And now, here is the end to my post giving you something this movie didn't. Thank you for reading.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
"A House of Dynamite, were the events to occur during the Trump administration","Netflix made this movie available for streaming yesterday; I watched it last night. While watching I couldn’t stop thinking about how the same scenario would play out today, with Trump and his political and military appointees in charge. If you’ve seen it, I’m curious what people here imagine would happen, if today a single ICBM with an unknown point of origin (perhaps due to a compromised defense network) appeared over the Pacific with 25 minutes to impact somewhere in the United States. With our current SecDef? Unqualified loyalists? I don’t imagine the odds of even a competent administration getting things right are particularly awesome. I know this is a hypothetical, perhaps more suitable for r/whatif. But I’d rather hear the opinions of active and veteran service members than those of the general public. It feels valid and timely to post here (to me), given that the administration is going out of its way to ratchet up geopolitical tension, antagonize adversaries and alienate allies. 91B Combat Medical Specialist, 2291st USAH, 1990 1996.

Do yourself a favor and go see A House of Dynamite,"This movie absolutely does not enforce ""THE MESSAGE"" and in many ways undermines it. Its a great, tense flick, though it is inspired by book that didn't quite understand deterrence, it is a very authentic and spooky presentation of a nuclear crisis. I have a few examples that are slightly spoilery, about how this movie avoids ""THE MESSGAGE"". Firstly, while there are plenty of female and or black characters, they are not girlbossess, lucy sues or wonderkids. However, its how the movie handles two black characters that really cements it for me. &gt;!1. There is a young FEMA bureaucrat black chick who is, of everyone in the film, by far the least competent and energetic in her duties. She gets selected to be saved in a bunker, much to the upset of her colleagues that think she is incompetent and inexperienced. This plays on your assumptions and reiterates the reality that if nuclear war breaks out, the people who are saved in the preservation of p\[population and operations plans will NOT necessarily be the ones that deserve it. The character does nothing except react slowly and save herself, that is literally it. !&lt; &gt;!(There are also other competent and likable people of color in the film)!&lt; &gt;!2. The president is clearly meant to be Obama, played by Idris Elba. And, despite being calm and cool at the start, he's revealed to be just as unsuitable and indecisive, resorting to calling his freaking wife to decide whether to engage in a thermonuclear exchange. !&lt; &gt;!If the president had been modeled on Trump, the takeaway from the film for normies would be ""don't elect Trump to avoid this crisis"", which was the error Civil War made by going with a Trumpian president. Its message was ""don't start a civil war over politics, its not worth it"", but normies thought it was saying ""Trump will start a civil war"". This movie avoids that problem it plays with your expectations and the audiences concepts (right or wrong), about ideal leaders. The movie is basically saying ""even if your Sugar Daddy Obama is president, hes still just a normal dude at the end of the day and not qualified to make these calls because nobody really is."". The only way to win this game is to never play. !&lt; Its a breath of fresh air for a modern hollywood director, especially a woman, to be so unfathomably based. There are a few other Chekovs that don't go off i wont spoil here. The movie is awesome in a whole bunch of ways, but i just though the users of this sub would appreciate these tidbits.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

A House of Dynamite…🤦🏻,"What are we doing here honestly? When you really sit back and think about it, this was a movie about nothing. No it is not a psychological, open ended thriller that is meant to leave you guessing and interpret your own meaning. We didn’t need that many angles, that many countdowns and that many different perspectives. To each their own but the entire time I was DYING to know who sent the missile and what the appropriate response would be. We were given none of this. It’s like eating your veggies expecting a steak will come later and then it never comes. I don’t know about you but a movie like this is essentially pointless if we don’t at least get some sort of simulation as to what would happen next. Not to mention, they never even actually confirmed or denied that the missile made impact! What?!? This movie was all suspense, all buildup and no drop. Disagree all you want, after all it’s just an opinion but this left me dissatisfied and disappointed. 👎🏻",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
A House of Dynamite this was bad.,"It's been in theatres for a couple of weeks but if you're tempted to go see it on the big screen instead of on Netflix this Friday, I suggest you save your money and watch it at home on Netflix, or better yet, not at all! I thought this movie stunk. The pacing of the first third is fine, but when the second act starts, the rest of the movie is a snore with an underwhelming and unsatisfying ending. If you find yourself asking where it's all going, the answer is nowhere, it's going nowhere. Even on a subtextual level, it's like Kathryn Bigelow's response to the backlash she received after making a controversial political action thriller was to make a political action thriller that had nothing to say and therefore could offend no one. Here's a previous thread where some of you discussed the ending: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBigPicture/comments/1o4d5az/house of dynamite ending/ I think you're all being far too kind on it, this movie was a messy pointless slog, a real groaner/stunned silence type of beat at the end of my screening. I left mid credits but most of the rest of the audience were still sitting, perhaps hoping surely there would be some sort of post credits scene that gives a morsel of closure, but no such scene exists. Coming to Netflix this Friday, don't expect too much out of this one.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

Kathryn Bigelow's 'A House of Dynamite' Review Thread,"When a single, unattributed missile is launched at the United States, a race begins to determine who is responsible and how to respond. Cast: Idris Elba, Rebecca Ferguson, Gabriel Basso, Jared Harris, Tracy Letts, Anthony Ramos, Moses Ingram, Greta Lee, Jonah Hauer King, Jason Clarke, Willa Fitzgerald Rotten Tomatoes: 92% Metacritic: 88/100 Some Reviews: DEADLINE Pete Hammond &gt;To say this is an important film for our time is an understatement. Hopefully the current world leaders who have our fate in their hands are listening. “There is still time brother” indeed. The Hollywood Reporter David Rooney &gt;Eight years since her last feature, Kathryn Bigelow returns with an unrelenting chokehold thriller so controlled, kinetic and unsettlingly immersive that you stagger out at the end of it wondering if the world will still be intact. Though it’s less a war film than a drama about the aggressive threat of war, A House of Dynamite is very much of a piece with the director’s later career gut punches, The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty . The Guardian Peter Bradshaw \ 5 / 5 &gt;There are times when A House of Dynamite might seem melodramatic or stagey and yet maybe that is how it may well feel in the highest reaches of power – with everyone looking and feeling like actors in elaborate costumes whose roles had only one purpose: to deter aggression, a purpose which is now obsolete. It is a big chill. IndieWire Ryan Lattanzio \ 'A ' &gt;Hardly mere agitprop due to the stylistic intensity of its filmmaking, this gun to your head engrossing movie — with its eardrum piercing and death rattling sound design and a score by Volker Bertelmann so oppressive it could swallow you whole — also wants to shake you out of your slumber The Playlist Marshall Shaffer \ 'A ' &gt;The world is not governed by machines, as “A House of Dynamite” painstakingly showcases across all its frenzied operations. It’s run by humans. Bigelow’s film pinpoints a terrifying tragedy lurking unspoken in today’s world order: whether citizens place their trust in people or procedures, neither can be counted on to prevent mass destruction. BBC Nicholas Barber \ 4 / 5 &gt;A House of Dynamite is directed by Kathryn Bigelow, who made the Oscar winning The Hurt Locker (2008) and Zero Dark Thirty (2012), and once again she balances her knack for building excruciating tension with her devotion to deeply researched, no nonsense military and political authenticity. The resulting drama, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival on Tuesday will be released on Netflix in October, is more riveting than most thrillers, and more terrifying than most horror films. The Independent Geoffrey Macnab \ 4 / 5 &gt; A House of Dynamite stands as a grim and timely warning about the renewed dangers of nuclear proliferation. Another way of looking at it, though, is as the most entertaining Hollywood movie on the subject of potential mass destruction since Stanley Kubrick’s Dr Strangelove . Unlike Kubrick, Bigelow doesn’t offer much humour – satirical or otherwise – but this is a white knuckle ride of a movie in which the tension is ratcheted up to near breaking point early on, and then simply keeps on rising. German composer Volker Bertelmann’s ominous score, heavy on the strident strings, puts viewers on edge even more. Variety Owen Glieberman &gt;“A House of Dynamite,” a countdown to nuclear disaster thriller directed by Kathryn Bigelow, is jacked up with so many familiar MOR tropes that even though it’s trying to be realistic about what it shows you (spoiler alert: It doesn’t really succeed), it still has the feel of a self consciously jittery high end cautionary potboiler. Don’t try this at home! Or in the White House Situation Room! RogerEbert \ 4 / 4 &gt;Bigelow's ability to take a series of hypotheticals and render them into narrative actuality has never been more pinpoint accurate or merciless.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

A House of Dynamite (2025) is 1/3 of a good movie,"I watched ""A House of Dynamite"" yesterday and, unfortunately, I have to report my disappointment. \[I'm not a movie critic, I don't know how to write movie critique literature, and I have to admit that a majority of movie critique literature I read goes over my head. What I try to focus on is maybe being more disciplined than many professional movie critics, in anchoring my opinions to objective standards. I'll do my best at keeping my more subjective opinions out of this write up.\] SPOILER ALERT I'll mention plot developments that will ruin the movie for you if you haven't seen it yet. Watch it. It's still an enjoyable movie even if you concur with it having the flaws I lament. And if you disagree, it's an even more enjoyable one. Premise: I'm a lover of the nuclear crisis movie genre. I've seen them all. I think it's impossible watch this movie without measuring it against the many (and many great ones) that have been made on the topic: The Day After, Fail Safe (both the 1964 original, and its 2000 remake), War Games, By Dawn's Early Light, Crimson Tide. Bigelow has chosen a genre in which a lot of good work has already been done. The comparison is hard. In the first thirty minutes of the movie we learn that an SLBM has been launched toward the US, and later we learn it's targeting Chicago. Our response forces send up two interceptor missiles which fail, and the device is set to hit Chicago. The exposition is extremely procedural: we literally sit in the rooms where decisions are taken, with the frustration of having to make decisions potentially affecting hundreds of million of lives, but on the basis of limited and ambiguous information. I'm no expert, but the procedural aspects seem well researched and re created. The cast is stellar. The acting is top notch. The dialogues are reasonably realistic. There doesn't seem to be any over the top overdramatization that many other movies insist on. The thing at which Bigelow excels in these first thirty minutes is the masterful creation of suspense. The build up of tension is extremely skillful and reaches all the intended intensity or more. I enjoyed that greatly. The device is now only a few minutes from impact the world is holding its breath. The entire horrific gamut of possible consequences from any foreseeable course of action has been explained to us. We are in the same room with people who are likely not to see the next 48 hours. We see the designated survivors being gathered and bussed to mountain complexes. We watch the moral dilemmas of them and their non designated colleagues. We This aspect is supremely well done. But then, hard stop. The story rewinds, and gets told again from a second perspective. We catch a breath of relief, but now the dialogues replay, and honestly the extra level of detail offered from the second perspective is not that valuable. If it is, it's marginally valuable for character development but almost negligible to the plot line. We still don't know if Chicago is going to be incinerated. We implicitly hope that the second retelling will move a bit forward past the firs, but we'll be disappointed it won't. Instead, the same thing happens again. Events are told a third time. Now there's almost nothing of value we know about the plot, and the fear that we are going to be left dangling is starting to build up. The story gets retold a third time, and then left abandoned in medias res. We will never know whether Chicago will be incinerated. We will never know if America will choose to retaliate and how. We will never know the rest of the story. I haven't read reviews yet because I wanted to write my notes with a virgin mind, but I bet many will say ""that's the entire point"". In other words, critics will say it was emphatically the writer's and the director's intent to leave us with a very partial view of the story precisely to signify that, in a nuclear conflict, the Fog of War dominates, and partiality of information is THE dominating factor. In a full out nuclear conflict, most of us will die without exactly knowing the sequence of events. In fact, not even our political and military leaders might know exactly what happened. It's fair to give the viewer a taste of what that feels like. And I'm ok with that. I'll take it. And still it feels like a lazy excuse for the lazy storyline. What I dislike is the initial, deceiving fast event progression, getting the viewer to 1/3 of the run time with a built up expectations we will see twice more as many events toward a resolution, but then abruptly being denied ANY more events. We will rather be strung along for the remaining two thirds of the movie with no more plot development. So, while the overall production quality is high, I find that the story development choices can't, IMHO, but leave the viewer profoundly disappointed. That's why my feeling is that the movie is ""a third"" of a very good movie, repeated three times, rather than a good movie.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

A House of Dynamite ending discussion,"SPOILERS AHEAD!!! I really enjoyed A House of Dynamite, but I was a bit let down by its ending. It was a solid 8/10 movie, but the ending bumped it down to a 7 for me. (Ignore all the moral posturing on letterboxd though, it’s still pretty good). The repetitive structure worked for me tbh, and the cast was excellent across the board, especially Rebecca Ferguson and Jarred Harris. Starting from the hyper competent experts doing their jobs to perfection, moving up the chain to intelligent bureaucrats, with the final decision on the fate of the world resting on the shoulders of politicians who, although well meaning, are not really much more than people with good social skills. You lose expertise as you go up the chain of command, but at the same time it doesn’t really matter, as it’s a pure value judgment at the end of the day. It’s clear that the movie is extremely against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the ideology of building up military capacity as a deterrent, so I’m not faulting it on ideological grounds. The ending kind of disappointed me though, even though I got what it was going for. It didn’t show the final decision, so leaving the cinema you had to think about what the president as you saw him would do, a guy who was by most standards pretty decent for a politician. Well meaning, lucid, and kind, but still beholden to public opinion, with no extraordinary skills or intelligence. Which immediately makes you think, “oh shit, if a man like that could potentially make the wrong decision, then if the actual man in charge has to make this decision we’re all fucked.” It doesn’t matter how many skilled experts and bureaucrats you have; the man on top is responsible, and the man we have on top is a malicious clown. So it’s clearly an anti Trump movie, I thought, even though it’s not explicitly one. Conceptually the ending works for me, but the entertainment loving casual moviegoer in me was still disappointed that it didn’t actually end with a bang or a big moment, that it was all left hanging in the air. Still highly recommend the movie, but I’m not too sure on its Oscar chances because it doesn’t really have a bombastic ending to make it as memorable as some of the other contenders this year. It’s a high wire act for most of its duration, but it doesn’t let you climax imo.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",Plot/Story/Interpretation/Analysis

'A House of Dynamite' Review Thread,"When a single, unattributed missile is launched at the United States, a race begins to determine who is responsible and how to respond. Rotten Tomatoes 87%, 15 reviews Metacritic 88, 13 reviews Pete Hammond Deadline &gt; A House of Dynamite is a wake up call, a cold shower, a reckoning, and one hell of a motion picture achievement. Nicholas Barber BBC &gt; Bigelow and Oppenheim can't avoid all of the old tropes of disaster movies and political thrillers – the captions giving each location its official acronym, the heart tugging phone calls to conveniently estranged or pregnant loved ones – but there are no grandstanding speeches or floods of emotion, and no wisecracks to lighten the mood. Ryan Lattanzio IndieWire A &gt; Bigelow’s work is procedural to its core, and that this film is a speculative what if is made all the more horrifying because of its banality. Robbie Collin The Telegraph 4/5 &gt; Bigelow, the Oscar winning director of The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty, has honed this premise into a razor sharp thriller of whats, wheres and hows, which leaves its audience wrestling with one of the great all time whys. Geoffrey Macnab The Independent 4/5 &gt; A House of Dynamite stands as a grim and timely warning about the renewed dangers of nuclear proliferation. Another way of looking at it, though, is as the most entertaining Hollywood movie on the subject of potential mass destruction since Stanley Kubrick’s Dr Strangelove. Peter Bradshaw The Guardian 5/5 &gt; Bigelow, with screenwriter Noah Oppenheim, broaches one of the most frightening thoughts of all: that a nuclear war could or rather will start with no one knowing who started it or who ended it. I watched this film with translucently white knuckles but also that strange climbing nausea that only this topic can create. Josh Parham Next Best Picture 8/10 &gt; There’s no denying what a powerfully rendered tale this is, both impressive in its filmmaking and performances.

Owen Gleiberman Variety &gt; It’s easy to watch, it’s wired to be exciting, with a showy hot button relevance, but the problem with the movie is that it isn’t quite convincing.

"A House of Dynamite was great, except a couple points that really bothered me (spoilers). What did you think?","Don't read onwards if you don't want to see spoilers. Just watched A House of Dynamite and really enjoyed it for the most part, really well done, good characters, production values and enjoyed how they showed it from multiple angles. But there were a couple things that really bothered me about it: Everyone automatically assumed that the incoming missile was definitely nuclear and definitely big enough to destory the entirety of Chicago's population. Nuclear weapons come in all shapes and sizes, and based on my reading it seems like warheads on missiles tend to be on the smaller end of the size spectrum for nukes. But that's beside the point because they had absolutely no proof that it was nuclear in the first place, could have been DPRK (or whoever) simply testing their missile delivery system without an actual nuclear warhead onboard. There was absolutely no urgency for the president to retaliate immediately. It seemed like for some reason he had to make a retaliation decision before the missile hit Chicago...but why? There were no other projectiles incoming, and they had no idea who had launched, plus my previous point. Nothing would have stopped them from just waiting to see what happened, figuring out who had launched it and then retaliating if necessary. I appreciate these points were probably done for dramatic effect, but for me it really took away from the story because it made no sense at all. And what about the inconclusive ending? Not that every film has to have a conclusive all loose ends tied up ending, but after all that build up it felt like a bit of a cop out, like the storytellers didn't have the guts to come up with what happened and what the retaliation was. Lots of different ways they could have played it, but this just came off as a bit lazy. Don't get me wrong, it was still an excellent film, but these points brought it down a few notches for me.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
A House of Dynamite debuts on Netflix to mixed reactions as viewers fume over ending.,"Kathryn Bigelow’s new thriller, A House of Dynamite, has earned mixed reactions from viewers in its first 24 hours on Netflix. From three different perspectives, the film repeatedly tracks the 18 minutes that follow a nuclear missile being launched at the United States — first from the White House Situation Room, then from the United States Strategic Command, and finally from the President himself. The identity of those behind the missile launch is never explained — a deliberate choice from Bigelow (the director behind war films like Zero Dark Thirty and The Hurt Locker). “The antagonist is the system we’ve built to essentially end the world on a hair trigger,” Bigelow told Netflix’s Tudum. The film ends on an ambiguous note — with the president (played by Idris Elba) deciding whether to let the missile hit Chicago to avoid a war or to retaliate. The actual impact of the missile is never shown. “I want audiences to leave theaters thinking, ‘OK, what do we do now?’” Bigelow told Tudum. “This is a global issue, and of course I hope against hope that maybe we reduce the nuclear stockpile someday. But in the meantime, we really are living in a house of dynamite. I felt it was so important to get that information out there, so we could start a conversation. That’s the explosion we’re interested in — the conversation people have about the film afterward.”",Plot/Story/Interpretation/Analysis

Can someone enlighten me on one plot point in A House of Dynamite?,"Of course spoilers! . . . . . A major plot point in this movie is that the president HAD to choose a plan for retaliation and it HAD to happen before the missile strikes Chicago. And I guess my question is, why? I do remember the explanation, that to not do so is to basically surrender, and or commit suicide. And maybe I haven’t been fully educated on the nuances of mutually assured destruction, but how do you select a retaliation target when you still don’t even know who the attacker is? The movie sidesteps explaining what decision the president makes (brilliantly or sheepishly, depending on your opinion), but the point is pressed, he MUST retaliate and it MUST happen before or as the bomb hits, before we know who fired and before we know if it’s a dud or not. I’m just a naive Canadian so am I over thinking this?",Plot/Story/Interpretation/Analysis

"Kathryn Bigelow's ""A house of dynamite"" movie review","Hey everyone my boomer friend and I have a youtube show where each week we choose a movie for us to watch. This week he chose 2025's ""A house of Dynamite"" directed by Kathryn Bigelow staring; Idris Elba (POTUS), Rebecca Ferguson (Olivia)and Gabriel Basson (Jake). The Good This movie starts with an interesting premise. An unidentified missile is heading towards Chicago and it follows the national security response to it. The first set of perspecitvies we see are from Olivia who is an officer in the White House situation room and Major Daniel Gonzalez (Anthony Ramos) who is the head of the team charged with stopping the missile mid flight. The tension raises fast and the sense of urgency is done well during this act of the movie. Rebecca Ferguson really shines here as she attempts to manage the White house response all while keeping her team calm. Another performance that stuck out was Idris Elbad as POTUS. WE see his perspective starting the day headed to a girl's basketball camp, and watch his day unfold as the missle is launched and he is tasked with making several tough decisions. The Bad While the first act really builds tension and sets the stakes I feel the movie starts to fall apart after that. They tell the story from three sets of perspectives which is an interesting way to tell it. Where this movie really fails is we see the same events from new perspectives but we NEVER get any new information. The story telling is reminiscent of ""Weapons"" from earlier this year, but what Weapons did right was each perspective brought new information and slowly moved the timeline forward (and backwards where necessary). Here, we start in the same place and end in the same place, not only that the ending doesn't resolve any of the questions it raised. I don't have a problem when a movie doesn't spoon feed you a button upped ending, however it has to give me something to think about. This ending on the other hand offers us absolutely nothing and doesn't seem to care. It plays out like ""Groundhog's Day"" except it's the audience that is forced to replay the day over again without the option to change anything. The Verdict This is one of those rare times where the Boomer and I agreed, this movie was a waste of an interesting premise and a good team of actors to tell a story with three first acts. 1/5 stars from us both, thanks.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

[A House of Dynamite] The US actually has no capability to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike at any point during the movie.,"In the movie, we learn: 1. An ICBM is launched from the Pacific. 2. There are no other ICBMs, just a single launch. 3. The launch wasn't picked up by early warning satellites. 4. No group is claiming the launch as theirs. 5. Chicago is the target of the ICBM. 6. There are no MIRVs, just a single warhead. 7. There are no apparent decoys (penaids). Here are some possible scenarios and their likelihood based on what we know from above: Nuclear first strike – Extremely unlikely. This is like if Russia or China was trying to destroy the US before it could retaliate. In this scenario, they would launch dozens if not hundreds of ICBMs and all of them would have MIRVs. The launch would also have been detected by the early warning satellites. Rogue submarine captain – Extremely unlikely. Same as above, a rogue captain would launch multiple ICBMs with MIRVs that would get picked up by early warning satellites and he probably wouldn't target Chicago. Accidental launch – Very unlikely. This could explain the single ICBM but not the lack of MIRVs or the failure of the early warning satellites, plus Chicago seems like a really random place to accidentally nuke. Also, an accidental launch would probably be followed promptly by the country that launched it reaching out to avoid WWIII. I could believe that it would make sense to keep quiet after an accidental launch but this scenario seems unlikely, mostly due to lack of MIRVs. North Korea might not have MIRVs but they're barely able to launch on purpose, so accidental launch (especially targeting a specific inland city) seems extremely unlikely for them. AI initiated launch – Very unlikely. Very similar to accidental launch above. Same issues where lack of MIRVs, only a single launch, and targeting Chicago don't make sense. Lack of MIRVs means North Korea but I doubt that they would have AI and that it would launch an attack like what's shown in the movie. This is hard to fully eliminate because AI is a black box that could do anything for no reason but I think it's pretty unlikely. North Korean launch – Very unlikely. This checks a lot of the boxes and seems like what the movie wants us to think but it doesn't make much sense. The movie tells us that a North Korean sea launch is feasible and that would explain the single ICBM, since they might only have one fully functioning ICBM to begin with. But after that, this theory falls apart. North Korea would also have no way to avoid early warning satellite detection and China wouldn't assist in a plot that could end in nuclear armageddon. North Korea also wouldn't target Chicago when it would be much easier to hit Honolulu, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, or Seattle. One of those cities would also give far less warning time. Most importantly, North Korea isn't stupid and wouldn't risk nuclear annihilation in this way. So all scenarios are unlikely? Where does that leave us? Well that's where I'd like to propose my own theory about what was really happening and who was behind the attacks. The crux of this theory is that a single ICBM launch is an extremely unlikely scenario to begin with. Launching a nuke is a highly destabilizing event and it's why none have occurred in the nearly 80 years since it has been possible. You can read more about it here, but suffice to say, there has never been a tactical nuclear detonation (only strategic) and that momentum has been a tremendously stabilizing force in the world. Nukes are a genie in a bottle and the scenario in this movie where a lone ICBM comes out of the blue is extremely unlikely. Any nuclear attack is extremely unlikely to begin with but it's next level bizarre for a single ICBM to be used. It should be expected that the explanation for such a scenario would be equally bizarre. With that in mind, consider the following scenario: My theory of what's really happening in the movie – As explored and explained above, there are no non desperate non suicidal scenarios where the attack in the movie makes sense, assuming the US has retaliatory capabilities. Given that the suicidal and desperate explanations seem to also make minimal sense, the only plausible scenario is that the US actually doesn't have retaliatory capabilities throughout the course of the film. That may seem extreme but it's no more extreme than a lone ICBM coming out of nowhere. As hinted at in the film when they discuss their systems possibly being compromised, I believe that's what is actually happening. I think an adversarial nation has infiltrated and compromised US computers systems, communications, and US Strategic Command as a whole. This could be AI assisted hacking or just traditional cyber warfare. The country most likely to be capable of this would be China, since they manufacture so much that relates to computers and are probably the biggest threat to the US in terms of military and superpower status by a good margin. The way that the attack in the movie works from China's perspective is that they launched one nuke at Chicago to test response time, intercept abilities, and to gather data in general. It's not a problem if the US shoots it down because there's more to come. The intercept failure could also be explained by China sabotaging it. It doesn't matter though because China is just listening in to the US reaction with their finger on the button to fully disable US retaliatory strike capabilities at the drop of a hat. Regardless of how many launches it takes, China's plan is to ultimately deliver a clear message that no US city is safe from their nuclear strikes. It's possible that it's a dummy warhead or there is no ICBM at all (China is possibly tricking the systems and sensors WarGames style) but it doesn't matter because the point is to demonstrate that they could nuke Chicago and for the US to realize that they have no retaliatory capabilities. For this purpose, Chicago is a good choice because it's a huge population that demonstrates the ability to hit any city while not actually disrupting US chain of command for when it comes time to negotiate. As mentioned in the movie, there really isn't even much of a military presence in Chicago. The scenario I'm describing here would play out like Japan in WWII. Chicago would be destroyed (or its destruction would be simulated to show that it could be destroyed), the US would attempt to retaliate, and they'd find that they're unable to do so. If the US decided not to retaliate then China could optionally back down after having learned a lot about STRATCOM and possibly destroying Chicago. More likely, though, China would be all in at that point and simply launch another ICBM until the US attempted to retaliate and realized that they couldn't. Similar to Japan, China would then threaten to nuke major US cities until the US agreed to unconditional surrendered, at which point China would get considerable concessions. The US would not be destroyed, it would continue to exist much like Japan did but under Chinese influence. This scenario explains why Chicago was chosen, why it involved a single ICBM with a single warhead, and why early warning satellites failed. China is basically just toying with the US and trying to learn as much as possible before revealing their incredible leverage. In this scenario, it would be likely that Russia would be aligned with China. China, Russia, and US stockpiles account for roughly 90% of the world's nuclear stockpile. France and the UK would still have nukes but it would only be a small fraction of the number controlled by China and Russia. That would mean that mutually assured destruction (MAD) would no longer be applicable and all of NATO would effectively be forced to give in to China's demands or at least not intervene. It seems like it would still be a dicey situation but it could definitely be worth it for China because it would mean becoming the sole world superpower in a matter of hours. Other countries would lack a non suicidal option once the US was compromised, plus China would likely survive even if other countries decided to act. This imbalance of nuclear power is not unprecedented. I'm struggling to find a source and will update if I find it but I believe there was a brief window where US ICBMs were unable to survive reentry heating and only the Soviet Union knew about it. I think the most likely scenario in this movie is cyber warfare but there are lots of ways that such an imbalance (or ""gap"" in Dr. Strangelove parlance) could occur in a way that would allow one side to take control. Another example would be if the US president was a sleeper agent. That doesn't seem to be the case in this movie but it would effectively make the US unable to launch a retaliatory strike. Doctrine is pretty clear that the President makes the decisions regarding nuclear strikes and that fact is pointed out in the movie when SECDEF tries to take unilateral action. Even after multiple US cities have been nuked, it could be argued that retaliation would end the world and thus no retaliation would be authorized. Refusal to retaliate would arouse no suspicion of a sleeper President because it's an unprecedented situation that's entirely the President's call and it's easy to make the case that no action should be taken, just as Jake did in the movie. My point is that there are plenty of plausible ways in which a nation like China could pour resources into a secret project capable of rendering the US nuclear stockpile suddenly and unexpectedly unusable. All this is to say that MAD it's a delicate balance that has created relative peace and stability for decades but any imbalance could be taken advantage of to radically reshape the geopolitical landscape in a matter of hours or days. In the case of this movie, I think that China is doing to the US what the US did to Japan at the end of WWII. It's the only scenario that makes sense with the facts given in the movie. The one caveat to this theory is that I think the filmmakers just did what was useful for the plot. I'm not sure why they picked Chicago but I do think that's why there was only one ICBM. A single missile makes it easier for the audience to follow along in a movie that's already chock full of technical jargon. At least within the movie, it seems like the reason for the attack and the outcome is meant to be ambiguous, but who knows if the filmmakers had a realistic scenario in mind that was the basis of the plot. I hope they did because it's kind of silly to create a high realism movie but to base it on an unrealistic premise. We may never know. For what it's worth, though, this post is my headcanon. For anyone interested in learning more, here's an incredibly interesting three part blogpost about MAD: https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2016/11/18/the president and the bomb/ TL;DR – The only scenario that makes sense is that an adversarial nation (likely China) has infiltrated and compromised US Strategic Command and that the US actually has no capability to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike at any point during the movie. Edit – Here's How Real is ""A House of Dynamite""? from the SpyTalk podcast where Former White House Situation Room Director Larry Pfeiffer discusses the realism of the movie. Around 22 minutes, the hosts seem to agree that the message of the movie is to point out the inadequacy of US intercept capabilities. I worry that many people will come away from this movie thinking that the US should have the capability to intercept as much as possible. For starters, it's not possible to intercept at a rate anywhere close to an adversary's ability to launch. It's not feasible to produce interceptors for a lower cost than the thing that they're intercepting and certainly not feasible to reliably stop all incoming nukes in the event of a first strike, especially when considering MIRVs and penaids. Even more fundamentally, though, doing so would be counterproductive. The relative stability of the last 80 years is due to a shared belief that mutually assured destruction would actually occur in practice. Countries don't use nukes because they believe it would result in getting nuked right back and ultimately result in the end of civilization. If you take away MAD by creating new technologies that allows one or both sides to intercept nukes then nukes become palatable, since the threat of an unmitigated nuclear apocalypse would be abated. The capability to reliably intercept entire nuclear salvos would make the situation similar to if we didn't have nukes at all, meaning countries could invade each other as they did before the advent of nukes. This comic illustrates the point. The hosts keep pushing the question about interceptors and Larry gives a good answer at the 42 minute mark. He explains that interceptors are mostly for rogue nations, i.e. interceptors basically move the goalposts so that countries with only a couple nukes are more like countries without any nukes, since their launches could be entirely neutralized. Interceptors don't destabilize (at least not significantly) so long as they remain ineffective against full nuclear salvos. There's still an argument that any interceptor capability makes nuclear warning shots more acceptable but those are still deterred by mutually assured destruction and launch on warning.",Plot/Story/Interpretation/Analysis

Could this be a BP contender? Absolutely and very much so. Will it be? Depends on how soon Netflix makes up its mind about their top priority. I think this should be their top priority along with Frankenstein though. Can it win? Nope. It’s too close to reality and too much of a devastating watch to digest and root for. Try watching this one in a theatre near you if you have that option.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

A House of Dynamite Suicide of Surrender,"By Kayvan Kaboli The story begins with a missile carrying a nuclear warhead traveling over the Pacific Ocean toward the United States. A House of Dynamite is a portrayal of dread, displaying anxiety in every second of the film, a narrative that is repeated three times throughout the movie, each from a different perspective. The first telling comes from the viewpoint of lower ranking officers whose mission under such circumstances is to shoot down the missile mid air. The same thrilling account is then retold from the perspective of high ranking officers and the Secretary of Defense, and finally from the vantage point of the President, the ultimate decision maker in issuing a retaliatory order to destroy whoever has committed such madness, a culprit that remains unknown throughout the film. In critiques and analyses of this movie, much has been said about technical aspects and real world military conditions. But what most of these reviews overlook are the two words uttered in the third retelling of the story, when the camera follows the President and the officer carrying the nuclear football as they enter the launch codes into the device: suicide or surrender. The film’s message clearly suggests that it does not matter which side has the upper hand in nuclear military capability or whose arsenal is more heavily stocked with missiles and warheads. Ultimately—when the situation has moved beyond deterrence and missiles are already in the air—there will be no winners; all sides will lose. In other words, the decision becomes one between suicide and surrender.",Plot/Story/Interpretation/Analysis

"A House of Dynamite, directed by Katheryn Bigelow, is terrible","This movie was shocking to me, both in how bad it is, and in that it seems like it was made solely as propaganda against the United States government and military. I was surprised by this, as Katheryn Bigelow directed Zero Dark Thirty, a very entertaining movie and one of the most dishonest pro military pieces of propaganda in the history of cinema. The thesis of Zero Dark Thirty is that torture works and that's how we got Bin Laden (which is bullshit bc torture usually gets you little to no actionable intel), and the thesis of House of Dynamite is if someone fires a nuclear missile at the U.S. everyone will panic and then Chicago will explode. I am critical of the U.S. government and its military, but they wage war and prepare to wage war for a living. In House of Dynamite every character responding to this incoming missile attack seems to be working their first day in military or government and is terrified by it. It's roughly two hours of ""there is a missile coming. We can't stop it so I should panic and prepare for us all to die."" If you study international affairs, specifically the Cold War, you quickly run into a concept called mutually assured destruction. It wouldn't make a great movie, but if someone fired a nuclear missile at the United States we would quickly identify the attacker and obliterate that country, and the ensuing exchange of nuclear weapons between the attacking nation and their allies and our allies would end human life as we know it. We have a bunker out west with enough nuclear weapons to explode the rock of the earth over 15 times. This whole movie it's just ""Chicago is going to be nuked, we can't stop it or figure out who is responsible, guess we are fucked."" The tension builds slowly to nothing, the movie ends before the impact of the missile on Chicago. It's two hours of people freaking out and not being able to make a decision, then nothing. Just a fuckin garbage movie. So much acting talent to tell a ridiculous story that goes nowhere, a waste of both the actors' time and the viewers.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

A House of Dynamite vs Nuclear War: A Scenario,"I just saw a trailer for Kathryn Bigelow's upcoming film A HOUSE OF DYNAMITE, and I was blown away (pun intended)...but not because the movie looks awesome (it does); no, I was blown away because it seems like a straight rip off of Annie Jacobsen's 2024 non fiction book NUCLEAR WAR: A SCENARIO. I only heard about Jacobsen's book because, in April 2024, Legendary Pictures announced they were adapting it with Denis Villeneuve at the helm. I read it last summer, and it's terrifying...and I would bet cash there's no way the writer of A House of Dynamite hasn't read it. There are too many coincidences, from the premise to the tone to the structure with the ensemble of characters. So, what gives? Is this a DANTE'S PEAK/VOLCANO situation? Or perhaps ARMAGEDDON/DEEP IMPACT? Do we think A House of Dynamite releasing in 2025 spell doom for the adaptation of Nuclear War: A Scenario?

"A house of Dynamite, like house of cards but shittier, shorter, and without good acting.","…or writing! Seriously I saw that guy at the beginning and I was sure he was gonna be named Ramirez or some Army Latino someshit. Waited 2 minutes and saw his name badge said Gonzalez, motherfuck. Wtf is this bullshit trying to convey? That the POTUS has complete control on nuclear worldwide devastation? That North Korea sucks? That USA has an 18 minute turnaround from launch detection to retaliation? They made it seem like the world is one AI hallucination away from needing the publicly elected chief in command to maintain the Nothing Ever Happens era. The film made the Russians seem cooperative and innocent, albeit oppositional in the BOOMEREST, cold warest kind of way. It was even included that some oligarchs’ yachts had been seized (by allies per the Ukraine war) and that was considered as a reason why they might stupidly launch a missile, even though they’re famously not stupid like that. On top, there was little to no Chinese commentary which I THOUGHT WAS RATHER STRANGE. The Pyongyang rhetoric was thick with libbrain, so much that it seemed far fetched and reaching . The so called DPRK expert only had to say that they had some tech and were trying out new tech, and could not be trusted in reporting their new, tried out tech. My personal take is that this whole thing was a thinly veiled “oh jeeze” event situation with China front and slightly off centre, even though the film gesticulated furiously that the DPRK were the launch culprits. I think the silence of Mandarin and Chinese politik was deafening. Is this what propaganda looks like now? Streamed films with AAA actors looking sweaty and stern over something that may OR MAY NOT be Chinese in nature?",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
A House of Dynamite is the worst fucking movie I’ve ever seen,"I’m legitimately going insane knowing I’ll be on my dying breath wishing I had just 1 hour and 55 seconds to spend with my family that I wasted on watching this abomination of “cinema”. The first act of the movie was pretty good, an interesting concept, then it starts playing shit that already happened from other people’s perspective, making me think I have Deja vu cause I’ve already heard these lines before, and here’s the kicker: THE OTHER PERSPECTIVES ADD NOTHING TO THE MOVIE, LIKE WHATSOEVER. It was infuriating to the see the movie pad for time like this. “Weapons” is a good example of how to pull this writing style off, this movie just massacred it. This is the worst ending I’ve ever seen since Game of Thrones and no this isn’t hyperbolic. I’m actually a pretty big fan of ambiguous endings, what I’m not a fan of however, IS ABRUPTLY ENDING THE MOVIE WITH 0 QUESTIONS ANSWERED AND 0 QUESTIONS TO EVEN THINK/REFLECT ON CAUSE YOUR TOO FOCUSED WISHING YOU HAD YOUR HOUR AND 55 MINUTES LEFT.

A House of Dynamite Spoilers/rant possibly,"It was not based on the book by Annie Jacobsen Nuclear War: A Scenario, that is being done by Denis Villeneuve Annie's book is pretty good, it focuses on the proccesses that should happen and take place while taking out the human element, the worry and emotion. This is how America should react in a scenario if it was perfect, it does take liberities such as the attack itself, the interceptors failing, being unable to contact other nuclear armed nations, president incapcitated etc. From a laymans POV on nuclear war/operations/proccesses which i clearely i am an idiot in i would say Annie's book would be quite accurate in regards to the timings and information she presents on various systems which are in place. I of course expect somethings to be hidden in the research or kept away from the public but it roughly is correct at the time the information was gathered and from interviews she pulled it from. Now if you have read the book the basic plotline of the film has just been ripped from it with a few details left out or changed and more characters added with a human element. It focuses on a few of the main processes but splices it with human behaviour and actions. Frankly ACT 1 was fucking great to a point, but ACT 2 and 3 were completely not needed and frankly ruined the entire movie, it if was a 30 to 50min film it would have been dead good because it built up the suspense quite well (think of Homeland season 1, last episode). The ICBM not being detected until flight was horseshit but i think they picked this option so they didnt have to name a country in this political climate so that made the timeline shorter. Chicago being the target, it is a population centre with no high level infrastructure, it is more of a terrorist attack at this point. Interceptor missiles failing, sending 2 incase more nukes arrive okay but send out 5 and its success rate varies and increases overall. Various characters taking 5min phonecalls etc, i know it is the human element but frankly they wouldnt have time for it in my opinion. Sec def committing suicide was random as fuck since most likely he would be man handled into the chopper, as would many other high ranking personnel and be moved to secure locations. Launching a full on response to 1 nuke basically obliterating the world seemed daft, it was only chicago, it was not at any key infrastructure militiary or civilian and you have the option of investigating afterwards which i think any sane person would choose to do at that time. ACT 2 and 3 were really not needed at all, we had heard it all before and it was just filler, the only part which would have been good to keep in was the president having to wrestle with the choice of launching or not which could have been spliced into ACT 1. No outcome at the end of the film either, do not know if it landed and detonated or malfunctioned and failed. For a political thriller watch Sum of all Fears as that goes through a scenario like this in the final act Maybe it was just me but i expected it to be better than what it was, the director aint no slouch but you could have cut and spliced from ACTs 2 and 3 into ACT 1 as to when certains things were happening at the time. Using splitscreens and timers and making it feel that you are on the call or in the room and how long is left till impact. Maybe i am just warped from Annie's book and automatically biased towards a version like that which i tbh i think i am, i like facts and figures not wishy washy emotion crap, i need the tension and realism that it portrayed in ACT 1. 8/10 for ACT 1, 3/10 overall.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

'Wicked: For Good' Review Thread,"Now demonized as the Wicked Witch of the West, Elphaba lives in exile in the Ozian forest, while Glinda resides at the palace in Emerald City, reveling in the perks of fame and popularity. As an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, she'll need to reunite with Glinda to transform herself, and all of Oz, for good. Director: John M. Chu Cast: Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, , Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Marissa Bode, Jeff Goldblum, Michelle Yeoh, Colman Domingo, Peter Dinklage, Bowen Yang Rotten Tomatoes: 72% Metacritic: 61 / 100 Some Reviews: Next Best Picture Lauren LaMagna \ 7 / 10 &gt;The cast, led by the phenomenal Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, still deliver fantastic work that is supported by excellent crafts from all departments of production. But the source material is inherently weaker than the first, making this a less fulfilling entry as a standalone, even if it compliments Part One as a whole. The additional scenes are not necessary and only exist for the material to be long enough to qualify its own feature film, which also results in pacing issues. BBC Caryn James \ 4 / 5 &gt;Let's be clear: the Wicked films are the definition of preaching to the choir. They aren't likely to win over anyone sceptical of candy coloured spectacle and overt sentimentality presented in Broadway show stopping fashion. Wicked is what it is. But if you're fine with that, this latest instalment is more captivating than the last and enjoyable to watch throughout. DEADLINE Pete Hammond &gt;What can we say about the performances that hasn’t already been said? Both Erivo and Grande could not be better, and in fact Grande really gets a chance to shine here and runs away with the picture whenever she is on screen. Erivo’s Elphaba remains the juiciest role and she defines it with the mortality only movies can bring. Bailey is terrific again, and Goldblum’s Wizard really comes into deep focus now and he’s got it going on. Marissa Bode’s wheelchair bound Nessarose is given some key screen time and delivers in a piece of casting that is as inspiring as the character she plays. Nathan Crowley outdoes his Oscar winning production design this time around, as does Paul Tazewell’s Oscared Costumes. The visual effects are first rate. So is this whole splendidly realized and cinematic musical adaptation which if you add up the running times of both films comes in just two minutes shy of 5(!) hours. To be honest I wanted more. The Telegraph Robbie Collin \ 1 / 5 &gt;Ariana Grande is painfully wooden in Wicked’s irritating sequel. What makes it so frustrating is that director Jon M Chu is an established musicals master; his In the Heights is a modern classic of the form. But the corporate stretch it out and wring it dry approach here has been deadening. Even the staunchest defenders of Wicked, the stage musical about the tragic origins of The Wizard of Oz’s Witch of the West, would have to concede that it peaks just before the interval... Slant Magazine Dan Rubins \ 2.5 / 5 &gt;But for as sharp as it may sometimes be, For Good is stretched out, breathless, and never really emotionally affecting, even on the level of nostalgia. (However bloated, the first film, to quote one of Glinda’s malapropisms, is thrillifying.) It may transport audiences, especially younger ones, to the colorful Oz for the bulk of an afternoon, but it also serves as a reminder that only in its tauter, wrenching stage form can Wicked , like a handprint on your heart, really leave you changed for good. Loud and Clear Joseph Tomastik &gt; Wicked: For Good takes many huge swings but misses in baffling fashion, making for a technically impressive but disappointing conclusion to the Wicked story. By all accounts, this is the much more difficult half of the story to pull off, as it’s where the musical in particular gets much denser and incorporates many more direct elements from The Wizard of Oz . Unfortunately, that difficulty rears its ugly head in Wicked: For Good . As ambitious as this movie is for tackling already unwieldy source material, those ambitions ultimately don’t pay off. RogerEbert Christy Lemire \ 3 / 4 &gt;If it sounds like this second half is darker than the first, it is, but it’s also more effective in its consistency of tone. “Wicked” was all fun and games until it wasn’t, and that sudden shift was jarring. In “For Good,” we know from the start that we’re in more serious territory with the deep strings of John Powell’s score as Ozian workers build the Yellow Brick Road. Erivo and Grande find just the right amount of tenderness and sadness with “For Good,” and that bond between them shines bright once more. Poignant and intimate, it’s a legitimate tearjerker. Bring tissues. AwardsWatch Sophia Ciminello \ 'C ' &gt;Despite stellar work from Erivo and Grande, Wicked: For Good can’t justify its existence as its own separate outing. Even with a pair of new songs and a deeper exploration of some of the musical’s beloved characters, the runtime feels bloated and bogged down by Chu’s constant attempts to make this a movie of the moment and to remind audiences of the connection they had to the first film. Simply put, Chu does not add enough new material to make this film feel like much more than a studio cash grab. There’s certainly still magic to be found in the movie for those who are seeking it, but when the credits finally roll, it’s difficult to say that Chu’s additions to this film have changed the world of Wicked for the better. The Guardian Peter Bradshaw \ 4 / 5 &gt;It’s tangled and a bit bewildering; but then so is the original film, in which we never know whether to believe in the Wizard’s final benediction. But what a performance from Erivo; it is genuinely moving when the Prince has to convince Elphaba what we, the audience, have always known: that she is beautiful. FilmHounds Paul Klein &gt;Erivo, Grande and Bailey are all fantastic once again, and allowed to deepen the characters more and show the complexities of them, while also remaining true to why people love them so much. It's a shame that the rest of the cast are given short shrift. Ethan Slater and Marissa Bode have the rumblings of a more interesting subplot that doesn't really go anywhere as much as it should. Even so, and despite its more frantic nature, Wicked: For Good continues to lovingly taking a look at what it means to be a rebel against dictatorships, how people will lie to you to get what they want, and how you must remain true to yourself at all times. It's not so much that the film is disappointing, that would be too harsh a criticism. It's that the film is merely as good as it could be, given what the stage show offers. It wraps things up, but there's no feeling of cohesion – something that was never going to be in Chu's hands, and for what he has, he excels at. Independent Clarisse Loughrey \ 2 / 5 &gt;For Good has little sense of movement, literally or emotionally – no profound revelations, no wonder or spectacle. All that’s to be done now is for each character to process, via standardised ballad, what they’ve learned.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

I’m probably gonna get downvoted but I did NOT like Wicked : for good,"I feel like I’m asking to get flagged for this, but I genuinely did not like Wicked Part 2, and it’s not because of the acting, or the singing, or the production. In fact, let me be very clear: Everything technical about the movie is stunning. The cinematography? Beautiful. The music? Gorgeous. The cast? They need Oscars ASAP. The vocals, the staging, the worldbuilding visuals? All top tier. And I’m saying this as someone who is obsessed with Wicked Part 1, like, Part 1 is my favorite movie ever. It was the first film I watched in theaters, I’ve rewatched it a ridiculous number of times, and it still makes me cry. Part 1 is magical, emotional, tightly written, and incredibly satisfying. Wicked : For good is the opposite. Not because of the performances. Not because of the production. But because the story is jus bad. I’m sorry, but it is, and I don’t even think this is a super unpopular opinion, especially among people who are new to Wicked. The Wizard of Oz shoehorning is painful,the constant need to align with Wizard of Oz plot points drags the story down. Part 1 stands on its own, it’s fresh, it has a clear emotional arc, and Elphaba’s journey feels powerful. Part 2 suddenly becomes a checklist of references, and it feels forced, messy, and anticlimactic. Every character arc feels unsatisfying, In Part 1, you see Elphaba rise, fail, learn, sacrifice, and evolve. You want her to become this powerful leader, maybe a protector of Animals, maybe a revolutionary, the potential is huge. In Part 2, everything collapses into nothing. • Elphaba never gets a moment of true strategic power. • Fiyero’s fate feels tragic for no meaningful reason. • Glinda becomes the “pretty face” leader in a way that makes sense narratively but still feels hollow. • The Wizard storyline is just frustrating, not compelling, and his ending is pure shit . And yes, I get the realism: No good deed goes unpunished, but there’s a difference between “realistic tragedy” and “emotionally unsatisfying storytelling,” and Part 2 falls into the latter. Elphaba’s choices make no sense, she has more magical ability than literally anyone in Oz, and this is what she accomplishes? She has no tact, no long game, no attempt at political maneuvering. She keeps sabotaging herself by being emotional in situations where she needed to be strategic. Honestly, Glinda’s whole “play nice in public, do the real shit behind the scenes” approach would’ve served Elphaba better, but instead, Elphaba jumps straight into maximum chaos mode and then wonders why it goes badly. Also, the magic lore feels contradictory, Elphaba is the only one with “real” magic but Madame Morrible also has magic and Nessa can read the Grimmerie. sometimes the words are sacred only for Elphaba but also not and at the end it's implied thst glinda now can do magic, it’s just confusing. I know this isn’t the film’s fault because it’s adapting the musical, but the inconsistencies feel more obvious in a movie. I just don’t get it, why does the Wizard get to escape? Madam Morrible was literally his lackey. They were both terrible, sure, but he was the architect of everything: the lies, the frauds, the prejudice, the entire machinery of Anima. He’s the one who set it all in motion. Yet somehow she gets jailed while he just slips away into the shadows? It’s pathetic, honestly. If she deserved punishment, then he deserved it ten times over. He was the main force; she was just the obedient hand carrying out his rot. The ending feels weak because it lets the real villain walk. Bôq’s story was fine, The Tin Man arc was the one part of Part 2 that felt coherent. His motivations made sense. His resentment made sense. It tracks emotionally, even without Wizard of Oz connections. Everything else? Messy. Part 1 stands as one of the best musicals/films ever made. It’s tight, emotional, dramatic, meaningful, visually stunning, musically perfect. You could build an entire expanded universe off the tone and direction of Part 1 ( think dune or star wars for the girls and the gays) Part 2, for all its visual and musical excellence, still has a story that feels weak, rushed, and frustrating. It’s not the movie’s fault; it’s the source material, but it still left me disappointed. I wanted to love it. I love everything else around it. But the story? The story killed it for me. Edit: the downvotes are pouring in 😅, people who Agree in the comnent should upvote atleast",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

'Wicked: For Good' Review Thread,"I will continue to update this post as reviews come in. Rotten Tomatoes: Fresh Critics Consensus: Taking one last lap down the yellow brick road, Wicked: For Good 's darker tone and unhurried pacing sometimes get in the way, but this epic conclusion ultimately brings Elphaba and Glinda's story home in rousing fashion. |Critics|Score| Number of Reviews |Average Rating (Unofficial)| |: |: |: |: | | All Critics |70%|246|6.70/10| | Top Critics |62%|47|6.30/10| Metacritic: 58 (57 Reviews) Sample Reviews: Stephanie Zacharek, TIME Magazine Life is too short for leaden fanfiction liked Wicked: For Good, an extravagant picture that’s not nearly as imaginative as it thinks it is. Mark Kermode, Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube) There are... some neat narratives twists. Peter Travers, The Travers Take It's a darker, gloomier, frustratingly less dazzling take on the Wicked IP. Should you still see it? Damn straight since Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande are twice as wonderful the second time around. 3/4 Sara Michelle Fetters, MovieFreak.com \ Wicked: For Good has precious little in the way of any actual magic. One might even go so far as to call it a bona fide dud. 1.5/4 Nell Minow, Movie Mom Jonathan Bailey gives Fiyero a quiet smolder as he goes from dancing through life to thinking about choices to following his heart. It is subtle, not a term that comes to mind when considering the joyful maximalism of the ""Wicked"" film. B+ Kyle Smith, Wall Street Journal That Wicked: For Good falls short of greatness doesn’t mean it’s bad. There’s plenty of cause to rejoicify, notably the visual splendor, the charming central friendship and some pretty songs, notably “For Good."" Caroline Siede, Girl Culture (Substack) While For Good wants to be a movie that inspires audiences to dig deep into its darker political allegories, ironically, it’s best enjoyed if you’re willing to turn off your brain and just get swept along in its emotions. B Naveen Kumar, Washington Post Despite its packed agenda, the film can also feel meandering and directionless. 2/4 Manohla Dargis, New York Times Even so, from its director to its cast, the movie is a testament to diversity (species included) as a common good as well as to love, friendship and solidarity. It’s on the side of kindness, which is itself, well, a balm. Aisha Harris, NPR This installment is far from a total misfire thank goodness Erivo and Grande are such captivating performers perfectly suited to these roles but the over padding and stuffing meant to justify this bifurcated packaging soon becomes readily apparent. Wendy Ide, Observer (UK) There is a crucial ingredient missing: humour. Without it, the spark is extinguished; the astringency that cut through the sentimentality of the first picture is gone. Peter Howell, Toronto Star It is darker, denser and in many ways more interesting than its predecessor, though newcomers should beware: entering Oz here without context is like being dropped into a tornado. 3/4 Johnny Oleksinski, New York Post Director Jon M. Chu shoots it with tender simplicity and just lets the pair connect and feel. He wisely shows much more restraint in Part Two. 3/4 Wenlei Ma, The Nightly (AU) Wicked For Good lacks the dynamism and energy of its predecessor. Without the razzle dazzle seduction and distraction double punch of the first part’s many, big, all in numbers, it falls flat much of the time. 2.5/5 Katie Walsh, Tribune News Service As it turns out, ""Wicked"" is not too big to fail. In fact, it may be all the excess baggage that weighs down the second installment, making it impossible for the sequel ""Wicked: For Good"" to defy gravity. 2/4 Carla Meyer, San Francisco Chronicle It holds too much space for trite dialogue, obvious special effects and pointless skirmishes between green skinned animal rights advocate Elphaba and the corrupt Oz administration — and too little for the story’s key relationships. 2/4 Donald Clarke, Irish Times If you bought the first film’s brash visual aesthetic – the result of a giant toddler vomiting candyfloss all over Walt Disney World – then you will be relieved to discover it has got no less stomach unsettling. 2/5 Kristen Lopez, The Film Maven Wicked: For Good sticks the landing as best as it can. When Erivo and Grande are finally together, it does leave ""a handprint on your heart"" even if everything leading up to it is just drawing that out. B Odie Henderson, Boston Globe The follow up to director Jon M. Chu’s massive 2024 hit is more of the same, only darker. The dark elements are written into the show’s second act, which even fans would agree is not as good as the first. 2/4 Matt Singer, ScreenCrush As the lyrics of the title song suggest, a change for good does not necessarily mean a change for the better. 6/10 Amy Nicholson, Los Angeles Times The first installment was all tedious set up. The second has a body count. John Nugent, Empire Magazine Not quite over the rainbow, then, but just enough of its colours and candour to get by. 3/5 Jake Coyle, Associated Press I rarely found myself lifted into a movie world, but rather sat watching it sometimes with admiration, rarely with delight from the mezzanine. The rub of going for maximum effect all the time is that the actors never have a chance to simply be. 2/4 Brian Truitt, USA Today Even with an overcomplicated ending and a couple of character development nitpicks, you couldn't ask for a more ""Wicked"" closer. 3.5/4 Caryn James, BBC.com \ This film is as slick and shiny as Glinda's lip gloss, but it may also be just what its many fans want. 4/5 Sandra Hall, Sydney Morning Herald No doubt the fans will thrill to the music all over again, but the impact is lost when every song seems to be straining to be a showstopper. 3.5/5 Tim Grierson, Screen International Ultimately director Jon M. Chu’s more is more approach has a numbing effect, the endless spectacle leaving little room for nuance, depth or genuine feeling. India Block, London Evening Standard Everything is stitched together beautifully to create an exhilarating piece of movie musical magic that re invents the Golden Age. 5/5 Robbie Collin, Daily Telegraph (UK) What makes it so frustrating is that director Jon M Chu is an established musicals master; his In the Heights is a modern classic of the form. But the corporate stretch it out and wring it dry approach here has been deadening. 1/5 Clarisse Loughrey, Independent (UK) For Good has little sense of movement, literally or emotionally – no profound revelations, no wonder or spectacle. All that’s to be done now is for each character to process, via standardised ballad, what they’ve learned. 2/5 Radheyan Simonpillai, Globe and Mail Like Fruit Loops that had been left sitting in a bowl of milk for too long – those bright solid colours bleeding out and leaving nothing but a soggy mess. Christy Lemire, RogerEbert.com \ The songs may not be as catchy this time around, but 'Wicked: For Good’ really sings where it counts: with the emotional ache of the fractured friendship at the story’s core. 3/4 David Fear, Rolling Stone Yet the sensation of a work that, in translation from one medium to another, no longer defies gravity but sort of roughly plummets back down to terra firma can’t easily be shaken off. Alonso Duralde, The Film Verdict Wicked fans can delight in one final visit to Oz, while those of us less enamored can hope that the yellow brick road ends here. For good. Rafer Guzman, Newsday Fans may find the movie serviceable enough, but others may find it underwhelmifying. 2.5/4 Kevin Maher, The Times (UK) They’ve only gone and done it. The makers of this musical sequel have delivered a film that surpasses last year’s box office smash in verve, ambition and emotional ache. 4/5 Peter Bradshaw, Guardian What a performance from Erivo; it is genuinely moving when the Prince has to convince Elphaba what we, the audience, have always known: that she is beautiful. 4/5 Billie Melissa, Newsweek Its sincerity, heart, and belief in a better world are inspiring, and Grande and Erivo deliver the message flawlessly, bringing us into their warm embrace to comfort and inspire. Peter Debruge, Variety The film fixes a common complaint of the show, giving the pair more scenes (and songs) together in this final stretch, which now feels like a robust tale unto itself. Bilge Ebiri, New York Magazine/Vulture It brings the Wicked cycle to a surprisingly satisfying conclusion, at least for now. William Bibbiani, TheWrap There hasn’t been a pre planned 'Part Two' this disappointing since the second half of Andy Muschietti’s 'It.' At least nobody projectile vomits on Jeff Goldblum to the tune of Juice Newton’s 'Angel of the Morning.' Danny Leigh, Financial Times It makes a neat takeaway for two bold, impressive movies, whose biggest achievement is to have (mostly) made their own complexity look simple. 3/5 David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter Grande floods it with so much feeling that it humanizes and enriches the character and, by extension, the whole movie. Linda Marric, HeyUGuys It’s a soaring musical triumph filled with standout performances, extraordinary craft, and an emotional core that is sure to delight fans young and old. 5/5 Kate Erbland, IndieWire The things that missed the mark the first time, well, they still do. The things that worked in “Wicked”? They still do, but only a clock tick better. B Liz Shannon Miller, Consequence For Good doesn’t sell Elphaba’s decree that ""no good deed will I do again,"" one of the movie’s many muddled moments. It does, however, reflect an age where every message feels muddled, no hero can be trusted. All we know is that something is rotten here. B Dan Rubins, Slant Magazine The film is stretched out, breathless, and never really emotionally affecting, even on the level of nostalgia. 2.5/4 SYNOPSIS: And now whatever way our stories end, I know you have rewritten mine by being my friend… Last year’s global cinematic cultural sensation, which became the most successful Broadway film adaptation of all time, now reaches its epic, electrifying, emotional conclusion in Wicked: For Good. Directed once again by award winning director Jon M. Chu and starring the spectacular returning cast, led by Academy Award® nominated superstars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, the final chapter of the untold story of the witches of Oz begins with Elphaba and Glinda estranged and living with the consequences of their choices. Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), now demonized as The Wicked Witch of the West, lives in exile, hidden within the Ozian forest while continuing her fight for the freedom of Oz’s silenced Animals and desperately trying to expose the truth she knows about The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum). Glinda, meanwhile, has become the glamorous symbol of Goodness for all of Oz, living at the palace in Emerald City and reveling in the perks of fame and popularity. Under the instruction of Madame Morrible (Oscar® winner Michelle Yeoh), Glinda is deployed to serve as an effervescent comfort to Oz, reassuring the masses that all is well under the rule of The Wizard. As Glinda’s stardom expands and she prepares to marry Prince Fiyero (Olivier award winner and Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey) in a spectacular Ozian wedding, she is haunted by her separation from Elphaba. She attempts to broker a conciliation between Elphaba and The Wizard, but those efforts will fail, driving Elphaba and Glinda only further apart. The aftershocks will transform Boq (Tony nominee Ethan Slater) and Fiyero forever, and threaten the safety of Elphaba’s sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), when a girl from Kansas comes crashing into all their lives. As an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, Glinda and Elphaba will need to come together one final time. With their singular friendship now the fulcrum of their futures, they will need to truly see each other, with honesty and empathy, if they are to change themselves, and all of Oz, for good.

"Ariana Grande in a vintage 1950s demi couture gown at ""Wicked: For Good"" after party in Mayfair, London. Sourced from Amarcord Vintage Fashion. Styled by Law Roach.","Dress description: Vintage 1950s gown. This breathtaking dress is made to couture standards and the details are absolutely to die for. Tiered, pleated tulle layered over two more layers of tulle, all atop a layered and structured taffeta full skirt. Strapless, ruched tulle bodice layered over taffeta and then lined in silk. Nipped waist makes the bodice fitted and enhances the full skirt silhouette. Zip closure at the backside that is then concealed with a row of buttons. Attached to the bodice is a sheer layer of tulle that is like a reverse cape, which buttons at the back of the neck and is open beyond that. You can leave it hanging or tie it at the back of the waist to allow for arm movement. And if it couldn't get better than that, all of this is adorned with handmade, pale pinkish white flowers, trimmed and centered in black velvet. Surprisingly, there is no label within, but trust us when we say that this dress is a masterpiece and is made to the levels of all of the greatest 1950s couturiers like Balenciaga, Balmain, Jacques Fath, and more.",Cast Performance/Acting/Actor Discussion

‘Wicked: For Good’ First Reactions Thread,"Please share any reactions you find in the comments below Last years reactions to ‘Wicked’ Clayton Davis WickedForGood flies high. Jon M. Chu helms an emotionally timely piece that deepens every spell cast by the first film. No surprise, Cynthia Erivo &amp; Ariana Grande are SPECTACULAR (again). You're NOT ready for the “For Good” duet. A heartfelt end to Oz’s greatest friendship. David Gordon “If Wicked part one was faithful to the blueprint of the stage, Wicked: For Good builds out the world to create a full and different (but the same) and extremely emotional version of act 2. It’s a thrill ride and a heartbreaker and it’s sexy and everything you want it to be.” Kobi Kassal Bring your tissues and watch out cause Ariana Grande is gonna win??! that Oscar. Jazz Tangcay Get ready because WickedForGood exceeds all expectations. Jon M. Chu is a genius in the way he brings this to a close. Elphaba and Glinda’s stories are expanded, and leave you with an emotional gut punch at the end. Cynthia Erivo is magnificent, but get ready for Ariana Grande as she takes this performance to the next level and is a tour de force. And wow, the world building, the costumes, and Alice Brooks’ cinematography deserve your attention. Can not wait to see it again. I sobbed hard. Wicked: For Good is sheer musical greatness. Destiny Jackson All Good Deeds Go Rewarded in Wicked: For Good. It’s an epic and heartbreakingly tender conclusion to one of the most dynamic friendships in pop culture history. There’s a lot for fans of the Broadway show to love with butterfly kiss sized surprises in store. With some reservations that I carried over from the Act 2 Stage Show to Wicked: For Good, I’m happy to report that… SOMEHOW I’VE FALLEN UNDER Jon M. Chu’s spell. He managed to make Elphaba and Glinda’s friendship more vulnerable and powerful. Ariana Grande’s soaring turn as the girl in the bubble is an emotionally complex tightrope that she balances effortlessly as she tries oscillating between the Good Witch’s need for perfection and the struggle for Glinda’s agency. Cynthia Erivo continues to imbue her gravity defying powers from Wicked Pt 1 and channel them into a new intensity of care, passion and frustration bringing to life an Elphaba that has had enough of that Emerald City bullshit! Full of love for her friend and for the place she calls her home, Erivo lights Elphaba’s verve on fire expanding more of the character than before. Jonathan Bailey continues as the heartthrob of a lifetime in Wicked: For Good. His performance as the playboy w/ a dislike for all things nerd ifying is a real no brainer . He digs deep to show just how much encountering the witch of his heart’s desire can change a man for good. Chris Murphy Saw wicked for good last month and believe me when i say that it expands and deepens the original source material in generally exciting and innovative ways. Cynthia and Ari take their performances to the next level with jaw dropping performances. The film fully sticks the landing",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
