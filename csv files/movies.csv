I just watched A House of Dynamite and are you actually fucking kidding me with that “ending”?!?!?,,Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
"Just Finished Watching ""A House of Dynamite"". Did They Like... Run Out Of Budget Halfway Through?","Spoilers for A House of Dynamite ahead. I gave ""A House of Dynamite"" a chance as Netflix was boasting it being their 1 movie for the day, and who doesn't love a good movie about the ever present threat of nuclear armageddon? But after spending two hours watching this blue balling collection of scenes packaged as a ""movie"", I am shocked this cut ever made it onto Netflix. So first, I want to say the first half of this is EXCELLENT. Not only does it do a great job of building tension, but I loved the premise of the situation rapidly becoming more and more dire. The idea that even with all our technology and people and protocols, we can still be so helpless is not only terrifying but genuinely thought provoking as well. And if they just stayed and built with that, this probably would have been an easy slam dunk. But then, the second half arrives. We backtrack to roughly all the same events we just saw from the perspective of others involved (between the President and General(?)). Now this is not in itself a bad choice. Different perspectives can be a great opportunity to get new information that makes our understanding of the situation richer, or just to understand more about how those involved are feeling. The problem is, though, we don't get that. Instead, we get a RECAP of what we just saw, with almost the EXACT same dialogue we heard before. And it is ROUGH and boring to bear through. For example, they make us go through the whole motions of waiting to see if the interception worked, even though we saw not even 20 minutes ago it didn't! There's no suspense here, why are we seeing this again?! And for the little bit of extra scene and dialogue added, we're not given anything that makes it worth seeing the events from these different perspectives. This was so bad I had to pause and make sure I didn't somehow rewind to the beginning. It genuinely felt like they took alternative cuts from the first half and slapped them on the second half to make the runtime. And then, the ending. Ohhhh my goood. Now I'm going to get some people here saying this is supposed to be an ambiguous and open ended ending, meant to leave us thinking and feeling hollow. The only problem with this argument is that it's bullshit, because it's just not an ending. If you were reading a book, and I copied and pasted a random line from the middle of my book, and made that the only sentence in the final chapter, would you consider that appropriate? Of course not! You would probably think it's an error or I didn't finish the book! So then, why is it magically allowed here? A House of Dynamite, objectively, does not have an ending. They took a random scene of the soldier collapsing from the first half of the movie, pasted it to the end, added a fade to black, and called it a day. If there was ANYTHING new here, even just a slight extension of what we saw before in this scene, then maybe I could get it a pass. But this is not the case. It's just... nothing. A House of Dynamite, in its current form, is flat out incomplete. It's a draft of a movie. It is 40 minutes of content that acts like it ran out of a budget halfway through, so it just repeats itself with deleted scenes and cuts when it runs out of those. I think what pisses me off so much about this is the potential with its concepts and what it tries to talk about. I love the aura of hopelessness and doom that permeates, and the conflicting ideas from everyone on what to do. There is clearly a great film to be had here, but it just... isn't here man. And now, here is the end to my post giving you something this movie didn't. Thank you for reading.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
"A House of Dynamite, were the events to occur during the Trump administration","Netflix made this movie available for streaming yesterday; I watched it last night. While watching I couldn’t stop thinking about how the same scenario would play out today, with Trump and his political and military appointees in charge. If you’ve seen it, I’m curious what people here imagine would happen, if today a single ICBM with an unknown point of origin (perhaps due to a compromised defense network) appeared over the Pacific with 25 minutes to impact somewhere in the United States. With our current SecDef? Unqualified loyalists? I don’t imagine the odds of even a competent administration getting things right are particularly awesome. I know this is a hypothetical, perhaps more suitable for r/whatif. But I’d rather hear the opinions of active and veteran service members than those of the general public. It feels valid and timely to post here (to me), given that the administration is going out of its way to ratchet up geopolitical tension, antagonize adversaries and alienate allies. 91B Combat Medical Specialist, 2291st USAH, 1990 1996.

Do yourself a favor and go see A House of Dynamite,"This movie absolutely does not enforce ""THE MESSAGE"" and in many ways undermines it. Its a great, tense flick, though it is inspired by book that didn't quite understand deterrence, it is a very authentic and spooky presentation of a nuclear crisis. I have a few examples that are slightly spoilery, about how this movie avoids ""THE MESSGAGE"". Firstly, while there are plenty of female and or black characters, they are not girlbossess, lucy sues or wonderkids. However, its how the movie handles two black characters that really cements it for me. &gt;!1. There is a young FEMA bureaucrat black chick who is, of everyone in the film, by far the least competent and energetic in her duties. She gets selected to be saved in a bunker, much to the upset of her colleagues that think she is incompetent and inexperienced. This plays on your assumptions and reiterates the reality that if nuclear war breaks out, the people who are saved in the preservation of p\[population and operations plans will NOT necessarily be the ones that deserve it. The character does nothing except react slowly and save herself, that is literally it. !&lt; &gt;!(There are also other competent and likable people of color in the film)!&lt; &gt;!2. The president is clearly meant to be Obama, played by Idris Elba. And, despite being calm and cool at the start, he's revealed to be just as unsuitable and indecisive, resorting to calling his freaking wife to decide whether to engage in a thermonuclear exchange. !&lt; &gt;!If the president had been modeled on Trump, the takeaway from the film for normies would be ""don't elect Trump to avoid this crisis"", which was the error Civil War made by going with a Trumpian president. Its message was ""don't start a civil war over politics, its not worth it"", but normies thought it was saying ""Trump will start a civil war"". This movie avoids that problem it plays with your expectations and the audiences concepts (right or wrong), about ideal leaders. The movie is basically saying ""even if your Sugar Daddy Obama is president, hes still just a normal dude at the end of the day and not qualified to make these calls because nobody really is."". The only way to win this game is to never play. !&lt; Its a breath of fresh air for a modern hollywood director, especially a woman, to be so unfathomably based. There are a few other Chekovs that don't go off i wont spoil here. The movie is awesome in a whole bunch of ways, but i just though the users of this sub would appreciate these tidbits.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

A House of Dynamite…🤦🏻,"What are we doing here honestly? When you really sit back and think about it, this was a movie about nothing. No it is not a psychological, open ended thriller that is meant to leave you guessing and interpret your own meaning. We didn’t need that many angles, that many countdowns and that many different perspectives. To each their own but the entire time I was DYING to know who sent the missile and what the appropriate response would be. We were given none of this. It’s like eating your veggies expecting a steak will come later and then it never comes. I don’t know about you but a movie like this is essentially pointless if we don’t at least get some sort of simulation as to what would happen next. Not to mention, they never even actually confirmed or denied that the missile made impact! What?!? This movie was all suspense, all buildup and no drop. Disagree all you want, after all it’s just an opinion but this left me dissatisfied and disappointed. 👎🏻",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
A House of Dynamite this was bad.,"It's been in theatres for a couple of weeks but if you're tempted to go see it on the big screen instead of on Netflix this Friday, I suggest you save your money and watch it at home on Netflix, or better yet, not at all! I thought this movie stunk. The pacing of the first third is fine, but when the second act starts, the rest of the movie is a snore with an underwhelming and unsatisfying ending. If you find yourself asking where it's all going, the answer is nowhere, it's going nowhere. Even on a subtextual level, it's like Kathryn Bigelow's response to the backlash she received after making a controversial political action thriller was to make a political action thriller that had nothing to say and therefore could offend no one. Here's a previous thread where some of you discussed the ending: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBigPicture/comments/1o4d5az/house of dynamite ending/ I think you're all being far too kind on it, this movie was a messy pointless slog, a real groaner/stunned silence type of beat at the end of my screening. I left mid credits but most of the rest of the audience were still sitting, perhaps hoping surely there would be some sort of post credits scene that gives a morsel of closure, but no such scene exists. Coming to Netflix this Friday, don't expect too much out of this one.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

Kathryn Bigelow's 'A House of Dynamite' Review Thread,"When a single, unattributed missile is launched at the United States, a race begins to determine who is responsible and how to respond. Cast: Idris Elba, Rebecca Ferguson, Gabriel Basso, Jared Harris, Tracy Letts, Anthony Ramos, Moses Ingram, Greta Lee, Jonah Hauer King, Jason Clarke, Willa Fitzgerald Rotten Tomatoes: 92% Metacritic: 88/100 Some Reviews: DEADLINE Pete Hammond &gt;To say this is an important film for our time is an understatement. Hopefully the current world leaders who have our fate in their hands are listening. “There is still time brother” indeed. The Hollywood Reporter David Rooney &gt;Eight years since her last feature, Kathryn Bigelow returns with an unrelenting chokehold thriller so controlled, kinetic and unsettlingly immersive that you stagger out at the end of it wondering if the world will still be intact. Though it’s less a war film than a drama about the aggressive threat of war, A House of Dynamite is very much of a piece with the director’s later career gut punches, The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty . The Guardian Peter Bradshaw \ 5 / 5 &gt;There are times when A House of Dynamite might seem melodramatic or stagey and yet maybe that is how it may well feel in the highest reaches of power – with everyone looking and feeling like actors in elaborate costumes whose roles had only one purpose: to deter aggression, a purpose which is now obsolete. It is a big chill. IndieWire Ryan Lattanzio \ 'A ' &gt;Hardly mere agitprop due to the stylistic intensity of its filmmaking, this gun to your head engrossing movie — with its eardrum piercing and death rattling sound design and a score by Volker Bertelmann so oppressive it could swallow you whole — also wants to shake you out of your slumber The Playlist Marshall Shaffer \ 'A ' &gt;The world is not governed by machines, as “A House of Dynamite” painstakingly showcases across all its frenzied operations. It’s run by humans. Bigelow’s film pinpoints a terrifying tragedy lurking unspoken in today’s world order: whether citizens place their trust in people or procedures, neither can be counted on to prevent mass destruction. BBC Nicholas Barber \ 4 / 5 &gt;A House of Dynamite is directed by Kathryn Bigelow, who made the Oscar winning The Hurt Locker (2008) and Zero Dark Thirty (2012), and once again she balances her knack for building excruciating tension with her devotion to deeply researched, no nonsense military and political authenticity. The resulting drama, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival on Tuesday will be released on Netflix in October, is more riveting than most thrillers, and more terrifying than most horror films. The Independent Geoffrey Macnab \ 4 / 5 &gt; A House of Dynamite stands as a grim and timely warning about the renewed dangers of nuclear proliferation. Another way of looking at it, though, is as the most entertaining Hollywood movie on the subject of potential mass destruction since Stanley Kubrick’s Dr Strangelove . Unlike Kubrick, Bigelow doesn’t offer much humour – satirical or otherwise – but this is a white knuckle ride of a movie in which the tension is ratcheted up to near breaking point early on, and then simply keeps on rising. German composer Volker Bertelmann’s ominous score, heavy on the strident strings, puts viewers on edge even more. Variety Owen Glieberman &gt;“A House of Dynamite,” a countdown to nuclear disaster thriller directed by Kathryn Bigelow, is jacked up with so many familiar MOR tropes that even though it’s trying to be realistic about what it shows you (spoiler alert: It doesn’t really succeed), it still has the feel of a self consciously jittery high end cautionary potboiler. Don’t try this at home! Or in the White House Situation Room! RogerEbert \ 4 / 4 &gt;Bigelow's ability to take a series of hypotheticals and render them into narrative actuality has never been more pinpoint accurate or merciless.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

A House of Dynamite (2025) is 1/3 of a good movie,"I watched ""A House of Dynamite"" yesterday and, unfortunately, I have to report my disappointment. \[I'm not a movie critic, I don't know how to write movie critique literature, and I have to admit that a majority of movie critique literature I read goes over my head. What I try to focus on is maybe being more disciplined than many professional movie critics, in anchoring my opinions to objective standards. I'll do my best at keeping my more subjective opinions out of this write up.\] SPOILER ALERT I'll mention plot developments that will ruin the movie for you if you haven't seen it yet. Watch it. It's still an enjoyable movie even if you concur with it having the flaws I lament. And if you disagree, it's an even more enjoyable one. Premise: I'm a lover of the nuclear crisis movie genre. I've seen them all. I think it's impossible watch this movie without measuring it against the many (and many great ones) that have been made on the topic: The Day After, Fail Safe (both the 1964 original, and its 2000 remake), War Games, By Dawn's Early Light, Crimson Tide. Bigelow has chosen a genre in which a lot of good work has already been done. The comparison is hard. In the first thirty minutes of the movie we learn that an SLBM has been launched toward the US, and later we learn it's targeting Chicago. Our response forces send up two interceptor missiles which fail, and the device is set to hit Chicago. The exposition is extremely procedural: we literally sit in the rooms where decisions are taken, with the frustration of having to make decisions potentially affecting hundreds of million of lives, but on the basis of limited and ambiguous information. I'm no expert, but the procedural aspects seem well researched and re created. The cast is stellar. The acting is top notch. The dialogues are reasonably realistic. There doesn't seem to be any over the top overdramatization that many other movies insist on. The thing at which Bigelow excels in these first thirty minutes is the masterful creation of suspense. The build up of tension is extremely skillful and reaches all the intended intensity or more. I enjoyed that greatly. The device is now only a few minutes from impact the world is holding its breath. The entire horrific gamut of possible consequences from any foreseeable course of action has been explained to us. We are in the same room with people who are likely not to see the next 48 hours. We see the designated survivors being gathered and bussed to mountain complexes. We watch the moral dilemmas of them and their non designated colleagues. We This aspect is supremely well done. But then, hard stop. The story rewinds, and gets told again from a second perspective. We catch a breath of relief, but now the dialogues replay, and honestly the extra level of detail offered from the second perspective is not that valuable. If it is, it's marginally valuable for character development but almost negligible to the plot line. We still don't know if Chicago is going to be incinerated. We implicitly hope that the second retelling will move a bit forward past the firs, but we'll be disappointed it won't. Instead, the same thing happens again. Events are told a third time. Now there's almost nothing of value we know about the plot, and the fear that we are going to be left dangling is starting to build up. The story gets retold a third time, and then left abandoned in medias res. We will never know whether Chicago will be incinerated. We will never know if America will choose to retaliate and how. We will never know the rest of the story. I haven't read reviews yet because I wanted to write my notes with a virgin mind, but I bet many will say ""that's the entire point"". In other words, critics will say it was emphatically the writer's and the director's intent to leave us with a very partial view of the story precisely to signify that, in a nuclear conflict, the Fog of War dominates, and partiality of information is THE dominating factor. In a full out nuclear conflict, most of us will die without exactly knowing the sequence of events. In fact, not even our political and military leaders might know exactly what happened. It's fair to give the viewer a taste of what that feels like. And I'm ok with that. I'll take it. And still it feels like a lazy excuse for the lazy storyline. What I dislike is the initial, deceiving fast event progression, getting the viewer to 1/3 of the run time with a built up expectations we will see twice more as many events toward a resolution, but then abruptly being denied ANY more events. We will rather be strung along for the remaining two thirds of the movie with no more plot development. So, while the overall production quality is high, I find that the story development choices can't, IMHO, but leave the viewer profoundly disappointed. That's why my feeling is that the movie is ""a third"" of a very good movie, repeated three times, rather than a good movie.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

A House of Dynamite ending discussion,"SPOILERS AHEAD!!! I really enjoyed A House of Dynamite, but I was a bit let down by its ending. It was a solid 8/10 movie, but the ending bumped it down to a 7 for me. (Ignore all the moral posturing on letterboxd though, it’s still pretty good). The repetitive structure worked for me tbh, and the cast was excellent across the board, especially Rebecca Ferguson and Jarred Harris. Starting from the hyper competent experts doing their jobs to perfection, moving up the chain to intelligent bureaucrats, with the final decision on the fate of the world resting on the shoulders of politicians who, although well meaning, are not really much more than people with good social skills. You lose expertise as you go up the chain of command, but at the same time it doesn’t really matter, as it’s a pure value judgment at the end of the day. It’s clear that the movie is extremely against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the ideology of building up military capacity as a deterrent, so I’m not faulting it on ideological grounds. The ending kind of disappointed me though, even though I got what it was going for. It didn’t show the final decision, so leaving the cinema you had to think about what the president as you saw him would do, a guy who was by most standards pretty decent for a politician. Well meaning, lucid, and kind, but still beholden to public opinion, with no extraordinary skills or intelligence. Which immediately makes you think, “oh shit, if a man like that could potentially make the wrong decision, then if the actual man in charge has to make this decision we’re all fucked.” It doesn’t matter how many skilled experts and bureaucrats you have; the man on top is responsible, and the man we have on top is a malicious clown. So it’s clearly an anti Trump movie, I thought, even though it’s not explicitly one. Conceptually the ending works for me, but the entertainment loving casual moviegoer in me was still disappointed that it didn’t actually end with a bang or a big moment, that it was all left hanging in the air. Still highly recommend the movie, but I’m not too sure on its Oscar chances because it doesn’t really have a bombastic ending to make it as memorable as some of the other contenders this year. It’s a high wire act for most of its duration, but it doesn’t let you climax imo.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",Plot/Story/Interpretation/Analysis

Nicholas Barber BBC &gt; Bigelow and Oppenheim can't avoid all of the old tropes of disaster movies and political thrillers – the captions giving each location its official acronym, the heart tugging phone calls to conveniently estranged or pregnant loved ones – but there are no grandstanding speeches or floods of emotion, and no wisecracks to lighten the mood.

"A House of Dynamite was great, except a couple points that really bothered me (spoilers). What did you think?","Don't read onwards if you don't want to see spoilers. Just watched A House of Dynamite and really enjoyed it for the most part, really well done, good characters, production values and enjoyed how they showed it from multiple angles. But there were a couple things that really bothered me about it: Everyone automatically assumed that the incoming missile was definitely nuclear and definitely big enough to destory the entirety of Chicago's population. Nuclear weapons come in all shapes and sizes, and based on my reading it seems like warheads on missiles tend to be on the smaller end of the size spectrum for nukes. But that's beside the point because they had absolutely no proof that it was nuclear in the first place, could have been DPRK (or whoever) simply testing their missile delivery system without an actual nuclear warhead onboard. There was absolutely no urgency for the president to retaliate immediately. It seemed like for some reason he had to make a retaliation decision before the missile hit Chicago...but why? There were no other projectiles incoming, and they had no idea who had launched, plus my previous point. Nothing would have stopped them from just waiting to see what happened, figuring out who had launched it and then retaliating if necessary. I appreciate these points were probably done for dramatic effect, but for me it really took away from the story because it made no sense at all. And what about the inconclusive ending? Not that every film has to have a conclusive all loose ends tied up ending, but after all that build up it felt like a bit of a cop out, like the storytellers didn't have the guts to come up with what happened and what the retaliation was. Lots of different ways they could have played it, but this just came off as a bit lazy. Don't get me wrong, it was still an excellent film, but these points brought it down a few notches for me.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
A House of Dynamite debuts on Netflix to mixed reactions as viewers fume over ending.,"Kathryn Bigelow’s new thriller, A House of Dynamite, has earned mixed reactions from viewers in its first 24 hours on Netflix. From three different perspectives, the film repeatedly tracks the 18 minutes that follow a nuclear missile being launched at the United States — first from the White House Situation Room, then from the United States Strategic Command, and finally from the President himself. The identity of those behind the missile launch is never explained — a deliberate choice from Bigelow (the director behind war films like Zero Dark Thirty and The Hurt Locker). “The antagonist is the system we’ve built to essentially end the world on a hair trigger,” Bigelow told Netflix’s Tudum. The film ends on an ambiguous note — with the president (played by Idris Elba) deciding whether to let the missile hit Chicago to avoid a war or to retaliate. The actual impact of the missile is never shown. “I want audiences to leave theaters thinking, ‘OK, what do we do now?’” Bigelow told Tudum. “This is a global issue, and of course I hope against hope that maybe we reduce the nuclear stockpile someday. But in the meantime, we really are living in a house of dynamite. I felt it was so important to get that information out there, so we could start a conversation. That’s the explosion we’re interested in — the conversation people have about the film afterward.”",Plot/Story/Interpretation/Analysis

Can someone enlighten me on one plot point in A House of Dynamite?,"Of course spoilers! . . . . . A major plot point in this movie is that the president HAD to choose a plan for retaliation and it HAD to happen before the missile strikes Chicago. And I guess my question is, why? I do remember the explanation, that to not do so is to basically surrender, and or commit suicide. And maybe I haven’t been fully educated on the nuances of mutually assured destruction, but how do you select a retaliation target when you still don’t even know who the attacker is? The movie sidesteps explaining what decision the president makes (brilliantly or sheepishly, depending on your opinion), but the point is pressed, he MUST retaliate and it MUST happen before or as the bomb hits, before we know who fired and before we know if it’s a dud or not. I’m just a naive Canadian so am I over thinking this?",Plot/Story/Interpretation/Analysis

"Kathryn Bigelow's ""A house of dynamite"" movie review","Hey everyone my boomer friend and I have a youtube show where each week we choose a movie for us to watch. This week he chose 2025's ""A house of Dynamite"" directed by Kathryn Bigelow staring; Idris Elba (POTUS), Rebecca Ferguson (Olivia)and Gabriel Basson (Jake). The Good This movie starts with an interesting premise. An unidentified missile is heading towards Chicago and it follows the national security response to it. The first set of perspecitvies we see are from Olivia who is an officer in the White House situation room and Major Daniel Gonzalez (Anthony Ramos) who is the head of the team charged with stopping the missile mid flight. The tension raises fast and the sense of urgency is done well during this act of the movie. Rebecca Ferguson really shines here as she attempts to manage the White house response all while keeping her team calm. Another performance that stuck out was Idris Elbad as POTUS. WE see his perspective starting the day headed to a girl's basketball camp, and watch his day unfold as the missle is launched and he is tasked with making several tough decisions. The Bad While the first act really builds tension and sets the stakes I feel the movie starts to fall apart after that. They tell the story from three sets of perspectives which is an interesting way to tell it. Where this movie really fails is we see the same events from new perspectives but we NEVER get any new information. The story telling is reminiscent of ""Weapons"" from earlier this year, but what Weapons did right was each perspective brought new information and slowly moved the timeline forward (and backwards where necessary). Here, we start in the same place and end in the same place, not only that the ending doesn't resolve any of the questions it raised. I don't have a problem when a movie doesn't spoon feed you a button upped ending, however it has to give me something to think about. This ending on the other hand offers us absolutely nothing and doesn't seem to care. It plays out like ""Groundhog's Day"" except it's the audience that is forced to replay the day over again without the option to change anything. The Verdict This is one of those rare times where the Boomer and I agreed, this movie was a waste of an interesting premise and a good team of actors to tell a story with three first acts. 1/5 stars from us both, thanks.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

[A House of Dynamite] The US actually has no capability to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike at any point during the movie.,"In the movie, we learn: 1. An ICBM is launched from the Pacific. 2. There are no other ICBMs, just a single launch. 3. The launch wasn't picked up by early warning satellites. 4. No group is claiming the launch as theirs. 5. Chicago is the target of the ICBM. 6. There are no MIRVs, just a single warhead. 7. There are no apparent decoys (penaids). Here are some possible scenarios and their likelihood based on what we know from above: Nuclear first strike – Extremely unlikely. This is like if Russia or China was trying to destroy the US before it could retaliate. In this scenario, they would launch dozens if not hundreds of ICBMs and all of them would have MIRVs. The launch would also have been detected by the early warning satellites. Rogue submarine captain – Extremely unlikely. Same as above, a rogue captain would launch multiple ICBMs with MIRVs that would get picked up by early warning satellites and he probably wouldn't target Chicago. Accidental launch – Very unlikely. This could explain the single ICBM but not the lack of MIRVs or the failure of the early warning satellites, plus Chicago seems like a really random place to accidentally nuke. Also, an accidental launch would probably be followed promptly by the country that launched it reaching out to avoid WWIII. I could believe that it would make sense to keep quiet after an accidental launch but this scenario seems unlikely, mostly due to lack of MIRVs. North Korea might not have MIRVs but they're barely able to launch on purpose, so accidental launch (especially targeting a specific inland city) seems extremely unlikely for them. AI initiated launch – Very unlikely. Very similar to accidental launch above. Same issues where lack of MIRVs, only a single launch, and targeting Chicago don't make sense. Lack of MIRVs means North Korea but I doubt that they would have AI and that it would launch an attack like what's shown in the movie. This is hard to fully eliminate because AI is a black box that could do anything for no reason but I think it's pretty unlikely. North Korean launch – Very unlikely. This checks a lot of the boxes and seems like what the movie wants us to think but it doesn't make much sense. The movie tells us that a North Korean sea launch is feasible and that would explain the single ICBM, since they might only have one fully functioning ICBM to begin with. But after that, this theory falls apart. North Korea would also have no way to avoid early warning satellite detection and China wouldn't assist in a plot that could end in nuclear armageddon. North Korea also wouldn't target Chicago when it would be much easier to hit Honolulu, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, or Seattle. One of those cities would also give far less warning time. Most importantly, North Korea isn't stupid and wouldn't risk nuclear annihilation in this way. So all scenarios are unlikely? Where does that leave us? Well that's where I'd like to propose my own theory about what was really happening and who was behind the attacks. The crux of this theory is that a single ICBM launch is an extremely unlikely scenario to begin with. Launching a nuke is a highly destabilizing event and it's why none have occurred in the nearly 80 years since it has been possible. You can read more about it here, but suffice to say, there has never been a tactical nuclear detonation (only strategic) and that momentum has been a tremendously stabilizing force in the world. Nukes are a genie in a bottle and the scenario in this movie where a lone ICBM comes out of the blue is extremely unlikely. Any nuclear attack is extremely unlikely to begin with but it's next level bizarre for a single ICBM to be used. It should be expected that the explanation for such a scenario would be equally bizarre. With that in mind, consider the following scenario: My theory of what's really happening in the movie – As explored and explained above, there are no non desperate non suicidal scenarios where the attack in the movie makes sense, assuming the US has retaliatory capabilities. Given that the suicidal and desperate explanations seem to also make minimal sense, the only plausible scenario is that the US actually doesn't have retaliatory capabilities throughout the course of the film. That may seem extreme but it's no more extreme than a lone ICBM coming out of nowhere. As hinted at in the film when they discuss their systems possibly being compromised, I believe that's what is actually happening. I think an adversarial nation has infiltrated and compromised US computers systems, communications, and US Strategic Command as a whole. This could be AI assisted hacking or just traditional cyber warfare. The country most likely to be capable of this would be China, since they manufacture so much that relates to computers and are probably the biggest threat to the US in terms of military and superpower status by a good margin. The way that the attack in the movie works from China's perspective is that they launched one nuke at Chicago to test response time, intercept abilities, and to gather data in general. It's not a problem if the US shoots it down because there's more to come. The intercept failure could also be explained by China sabotaging it. It doesn't matter though because China is just listening in to the US reaction with their finger on the button to fully disable US retaliatory strike capabilities at the drop of a hat. Regardless of how many launches it takes, China's plan is to ultimately deliver a clear message that no US city is safe from their nuclear strikes. It's possible that it's a dummy warhead or there is no ICBM at all (China is possibly tricking the systems and sensors WarGames style) but it doesn't matter because the point is to demonstrate that they could nuke Chicago and for the US to realize that they have no retaliatory capabilities. For this purpose, Chicago is a good choice because it's a huge population that demonstrates the ability to hit any city while not actually disrupting US chain of command for when it comes time to negotiate. As mentioned in the movie, there really isn't even much of a military presence in Chicago. The scenario I'm describing here would play out like Japan in WWII. Chicago would be destroyed (or its destruction would be simulated to show that it could be destroyed), the US would attempt to retaliate, and they'd find that they're unable to do so. If the US decided not to retaliate then China could optionally back down after having learned a lot about STRATCOM and possibly destroying Chicago. More likely, though, China would be all in at that point and simply launch another ICBM until the US attempted to retaliate and realized that they couldn't. Similar to Japan, China would then threaten to nuke major US cities until the US agreed to unconditional surrendered, at which point China would get considerable concessions. The US would not be destroyed, it would continue to exist much like Japan did but under Chinese influence. This scenario explains why Chicago was chosen, why it involved a single ICBM with a single warhead, and why early warning satellites failed. China is basically just toying with the US and trying to learn as much as possible before revealing their incredible leverage. In this scenario, it would be likely that Russia would be aligned with China. China, Russia, and US stockpiles account for roughly 90% of the world's nuclear stockpile. France and the UK would still have nukes but it would only be a small fraction of the number controlled by China and Russia. That would mean that mutually assured destruction (MAD) would no longer be applicable and all of NATO would effectively be forced to give in to China's demands or at least not intervene. It seems like it would still be a dicey situation but it could definitely be worth it for China because it would mean becoming the sole world superpower in a matter of hours. Other countries would lack a non suicidal option once the US was compromised, plus China would likely survive even if other countries decided to act. This imbalance of nuclear power is not unprecedented. I'm struggling to find a source and will update if I find it but I believe there was a brief window where US ICBMs were unable to survive reentry heating and only the Soviet Union knew about it. I think the most likely scenario in this movie is cyber warfare but there are lots of ways that such an imbalance (or ""gap"" in Dr. Strangelove parlance) could occur in a way that would allow one side to take control. Another example would be if the US president was a sleeper agent. That doesn't seem to be the case in this movie but it would effectively make the US unable to launch a retaliatory strike. Doctrine is pretty clear that the President makes the decisions regarding nuclear strikes and that fact is pointed out in the movie when SECDEF tries to take unilateral action. Even after multiple US cities have been nuked, it could be argued that retaliation would end the world and thus no retaliation would be authorized. Refusal to retaliate would arouse no suspicion of a sleeper President because it's an unprecedented situation that's entirely the President's call and it's easy to make the case that no action should be taken, just as Jake did in the movie. My point is that there are plenty of plausible ways in which a nation like China could pour resources into a secret project capable of rendering the US nuclear stockpile suddenly and unexpectedly unusable. All this is to say that MAD it's a delicate balance that has created relative peace and stability for decades but any imbalance could be taken advantage of to radically reshape the geopolitical landscape in a matter of hours or days. In the case of this movie, I think that China is doing to the US what the US did to Japan at the end of WWII. It's the only scenario that makes sense with the facts given in the movie. The one caveat to this theory is that I think the filmmakers just did what was useful for the plot. I'm not sure why they picked Chicago but I do think that's why there was only one ICBM. A single missile makes it easier for the audience to follow along in a movie that's already chock full of technical jargon. At least within the movie, it seems like the reason for the attack and the outcome is meant to be ambiguous, but who knows if the filmmakers had a realistic scenario in mind that was the basis of the plot. I hope they did because it's kind of silly to create a high realism movie but to base it on an unrealistic premise. We may never know. For what it's worth, though, this post is my headcanon. For anyone interested in learning more, here's an incredibly interesting three part blogpost about MAD: https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2016/11/18/the president and the bomb/ TL;DR – The only scenario that makes sense is that an adversarial nation (likely China) has infiltrated and compromised US Strategic Command and that the US actually has no capability to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike at any point during the movie. Edit – Here's How Real is ""A House of Dynamite""? from the SpyTalk podcast where Former White House Situation Room Director Larry Pfeiffer discusses the realism of the movie. Around 22 minutes, the hosts seem to agree that the message of the movie is to point out the inadequacy of US intercept capabilities. I worry that many people will come away from this movie thinking that the US should have the capability to intercept as much as possible. For starters, it's not possible to intercept at a rate anywhere close to an adversary's ability to launch. It's not feasible to produce interceptors for a lower cost than the thing that they're intercepting and certainly not feasible to reliably stop all incoming nukes in the event of a first strike, especially when considering MIRVs and penaids. Even more fundamentally, though, doing so would be counterproductive. The relative stability of the last 80 years is due to a shared belief that mutually assured destruction would actually occur in practice. Countries don't use nukes because they believe it would result in getting nuked right back and ultimately result in the end of civilization. If you take away MAD by creating new technologies that allows one or both sides to intercept nukes then nukes become palatable, since the threat of an unmitigated nuclear apocalypse would be abated. The capability to reliably intercept entire nuclear salvos would make the situation similar to if we didn't have nukes at all, meaning countries could invade each other as they did before the advent of nukes. This comic illustrates the point. The hosts keep pushing the question about interceptors and Larry gives a good answer at the 42 minute mark. He explains that interceptors are mostly for rogue nations, i.e. interceptors basically move the goalposts so that countries with only a couple nukes are more like countries without any nukes, since their launches could be entirely neutralized. Interceptors don't destabilize (at least not significantly) so long as they remain ineffective against full nuclear salvos. There's still an argument that any interceptor capability makes nuclear warning shots more acceptable but those are still deterred by mutually assured destruction and launch on warning.",Plot/Story/Interpretation/Analysis

A House of Dynamite Suicide of Surrender,"By Kayvan Kaboli The story begins with a missile carrying a nuclear warhead traveling over the Pacific Ocean toward the United States. A House of Dynamite is a portrayal of dread, displaying anxiety in every second of the film, a narrative that is repeated three times throughout the movie, each from a different perspective. The first telling comes from the viewpoint of lower ranking officers whose mission under such circumstances is to shoot down the missile mid air. The same thrilling account is then retold from the perspective of high ranking officers and the Secretary of Defense, and finally from the vantage point of the President, the ultimate decision maker in issuing a retaliatory order to destroy whoever has committed such madness, a culprit that remains unknown throughout the film. In critiques and analyses of this movie, much has been said about technical aspects and real world military conditions. But what most of these reviews overlook are the two words uttered in the third retelling of the story, when the camera follows the President and the officer carrying the nuclear football as they enter the launch codes into the device: suicide or surrender. The film’s message clearly suggests that it does not matter which side has the upper hand in nuclear military capability or whose arsenal is more heavily stocked with missiles and warheads. Ultimately—when the situation has moved beyond deterrence and missiles are already in the air—there will be no winners; all sides will lose. In other words, the decision becomes one between suicide and surrender.",Plot/Story/Interpretation/Analysis

"A House of Dynamite, directed by Katheryn Bigelow, is terrible","This movie was shocking to me, both in how bad it is, and in that it seems like it was made solely as propaganda against the United States government and military. I was surprised by this, as Katheryn Bigelow directed Zero Dark Thirty, a very entertaining movie and one of the most dishonest pro military pieces of propaganda in the history of cinema. The thesis of Zero Dark Thirty is that torture works and that's how we got Bin Laden (which is bullshit bc torture usually gets you little to no actionable intel), and the thesis of House of Dynamite is if someone fires a nuclear missile at the U.S. everyone will panic and then Chicago will explode. I am critical of the U.S. government and its military, but they wage war and prepare to wage war for a living. In House of Dynamite every character responding to this incoming missile attack seems to be working their first day in military or government and is terrified by it. It's roughly two hours of ""there is a missile coming. We can't stop it so I should panic and prepare for us all to die."" If you study international affairs, specifically the Cold War, you quickly run into a concept called mutually assured destruction. It wouldn't make a great movie, but if someone fired a nuclear missile at the United States we would quickly identify the attacker and obliterate that country, and the ensuing exchange of nuclear weapons between the attacking nation and their allies and our allies would end human life as we know it. We have a bunker out west with enough nuclear weapons to explode the rock of the earth over 15 times. This whole movie it's just ""Chicago is going to be nuked, we can't stop it or figure out who is responsible, guess we are fucked."" The tension builds slowly to nothing, the movie ends before the impact of the missile on Chicago. It's two hours of people freaking out and not being able to make a decision, then nothing. Just a fuckin garbage movie. So much acting talent to tell a ridiculous story that goes nowhere, a waste of both the actors' time and the viewers.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

That USA has an 18 minute turnaround from launch detection to retaliation?

The film made the Russians seem cooperative and innocent, albeit oppositional in the BOOMEREST, cold warest kind of way. It was even included that some oligarchs’ yachts had been seized (by allies per the Ukraine war) and that was considered as a reason why they might stupidly launch a missile, even though they’re famously not stupid like that. On top, there was little to no Chinese commentary which I THOUGHT WAS RATHER STRANGE. The Pyongyang rhetoric was thick with libbrain, so much that it seemed far fetched and reaching . The so called DPRK expert only had to say that they had some tech and were trying out new tech, and could not be trusted in reporting their new, tried out tech. My personal take is that this whole thing was a thinly veiled “oh jeeze” event situation with China front and slightly off centre, even though the film gesticulated furiously that the DPRK were the launch culprits. I think the silence of Mandarin and Chinese politik was deafening. Is this what propaganda looks like now?

It was infuriating to the see the movie pad for time like this. “Weapons” is a good example of how to pull this writing style off, this movie just massacred it. This is the worst ending I’ve ever seen since Game of Thrones and no this isn’t hyperbolic. I’m actually a pretty big fan of ambiguous endings, what I’m not a fan of however, IS ABRUPTLY ENDING THE MOVIE WITH 0 QUESTIONS ANSWERED AND 0 QUESTIONS TO EVEN THINK/REFLECT ON CAUSE YOUR TOO FOCUSED WISHING YOU HAD YOUR HOUR AND 55 MINUTES LEFT. I cannot believe this movie is 1 on Netflix. Absolute insanity.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
A house of dynamite,"Typically I will watch any of the movies the boys reference on the POD. I don’t know if anyone else caught Francis saying that A House of Dynamite was a great movie a couple episodes ago. Let me tell you a little something about the last 2 hrs of my life..fucking WASTED. Francis may have earned a purple heart in writing blogs for saving himself from a truly sad situation he found himself in recently with his position at the company (first class list), he might have a degree from Harvard, he might have wanted to become a lawyer at one time in his life (heroic and obviously would’ve taken the formal route). Whoever (probably his piece of shit ex wife) led him to believe that his taste in using his time for anything entertaining should apply the same laws of physics that the GBI’s (Ground Based Interceptors) used and go fuck themselves. My night is ruined.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
A House of Dynamite Spoilers/rant possibly,"It was not based on the book by Annie Jacobsen Nuclear War: A Scenario, that is being done by Denis Villeneuve Annie's book is pretty good, it focuses on the proccesses that should happen and take place while taking out the human element, the worry and emotion. This is how America should react in a scenario if it was perfect, it does take liberities such as the attack itself, the interceptors failing, being unable to contact other nuclear armed nations, president incapcitated etc. From a laymans POV on nuclear war/operations/proccesses which i clearely i am an idiot in i would say Annie's book would be quite accurate in regards to the timings and information she presents on various systems which are in place. I of course expect somethings to be hidden in the research or kept away from the public but it roughly is correct at the time the information was gathered and from interviews she pulled it from. Now if you have read the book the basic plotline of the film has just been ripped from it with a few details left out or changed and more characters added with a human element. It focuses on a few of the main processes but splices it with human behaviour and actions. Frankly ACT 1 was fucking great to a point, but ACT 2 and 3 were completely not needed and frankly ruined the entire movie, it if was a 30 to 50min film it would have been dead good because it built up the suspense quite well (think of Homeland season 1, last episode). The ICBM not being detected until flight was horseshit but i think they picked this option so they didnt have to name a country in this political climate so that made the timeline shorter. Chicago being the target, it is a population centre with no high level infrastructure, it is more of a terrorist attack at this point. Interceptor missiles failing, sending 2 incase more nukes arrive okay but send out 5 and its success rate varies and increases overall. Various characters taking 5min phonecalls etc, i know it is the human element but frankly they wouldnt have time for it in my opinion. Sec def committing suicide was random as fuck since most likely he would be man handled into the chopper, as would many other high ranking personnel and be moved to secure locations. Launching a full on response to 1 nuke basically obliterating the world seemed daft, it was only chicago, it was not at any key infrastructure militiary or civilian and you have the option of investigating afterwards which i think any sane person would choose to do at that time. ACT 2 and 3 were really not needed at all, we had heard it all before and it was just filler, the only part which would have been good to keep in was the president having to wrestle with the choice of launching or not which could have been spliced into ACT 1. No outcome at the end of the film either, do not know if it landed and detonated or malfunctioned and failed. For a political thriller watch Sum of all Fears as that goes through a scenario like this in the final act Maybe it was just me but i expected it to be better than what it was, the director aint no slouch but you could have cut and spliced from ACTs 2 and 3 into ACT 1 as to when certains things were happening at the time. Using splitscreens and timers and making it feel that you are on the call or in the room and how long is left till impact. Maybe i am just warped from Annie's book and automatically biased towards a version like that which i tbh i think i am, i like facts and figures not wishy washy emotion crap, i need the tension and realism that it portrayed in ACT 1. 8/10 for ACT 1, 3/10 overall.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

You train for the most extreme scenario imaginable, but your actual job is to wait. It’s like being on the world’s most stressful standby mode. You’re part of history, but your daily life is probably just… walking, standing, and waiting for something that hopefully never happens.

'Wicked: For Good' Review Thread,"Now demonized as the Wicked Witch of the West, Elphaba lives in exile in the Ozian forest, while Glinda resides at the palace in Emerald City, reveling in the perks of fame and popularity. As an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, she'll need to reunite with Glinda to transform herself, and all of Oz, for good. Director: John M. Chu Cast: Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, , Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Marissa Bode, Jeff Goldblum, Michelle Yeoh, Colman Domingo, Peter Dinklage, Bowen Yang Rotten Tomatoes: 72% Metacritic: 61 / 100 Some Reviews: Next Best Picture Lauren LaMagna \ 7 / 10 &gt;The cast, led by the phenomenal Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, still deliver fantastic work that is supported by excellent crafts from all departments of production. But the source material is inherently weaker than the first, making this a less fulfilling entry as a standalone, even if it compliments Part One as a whole. The additional scenes are not necessary and only exist for the material to be long enough to qualify its own feature film, which also results in pacing issues. BBC Caryn James \ 4 / 5 &gt;Let's be clear: the Wicked films are the definition of preaching to the choir. They aren't likely to win over anyone sceptical of candy coloured spectacle and overt sentimentality presented in Broadway show stopping fashion. Wicked is what it is. But if you're fine with that, this latest instalment is more captivating than the last and enjoyable to watch throughout. DEADLINE Pete Hammond &gt;What can we say about the performances that hasn’t already been said? Both Erivo and Grande could not be better, and in fact Grande really gets a chance to shine here and runs away with the picture whenever she is on screen. Erivo’s Elphaba remains the juiciest role and she defines it with the mortality only movies can bring. Bailey is terrific again, and Goldblum’s Wizard really comes into deep focus now and he’s got it going on. Marissa Bode’s wheelchair bound Nessarose is given some key screen time and delivers in a piece of casting that is as inspiring as the character she plays. Nathan Crowley outdoes his Oscar winning production design this time around, as does Paul Tazewell’s Oscared Costumes. The visual effects are first rate. So is this whole splendidly realized and cinematic musical adaptation which if you add up the running times of both films comes in just two minutes shy of 5(!) hours. To be honest I wanted more. The Telegraph Robbie Collin \ 1 / 5 &gt;Ariana Grande is painfully wooden in Wicked’s irritating sequel. What makes it so frustrating is that director Jon M Chu is an established musicals master; his In the Heights is a modern classic of the form. But the corporate stretch it out and wring it dry approach here has been deadening. Even the staunchest defenders of Wicked, the stage musical about the tragic origins of The Wizard of Oz’s Witch of the West, would have to concede that it peaks just before the interval... Slant Magazine Dan Rubins \ 2.5 / 5 &gt;But for as sharp as it may sometimes be, For Good is stretched out, breathless, and never really emotionally affecting, even on the level of nostalgia. (However bloated, the first film, to quote one of Glinda’s malapropisms, is thrillifying.) It may transport audiences, especially younger ones, to the colorful Oz for the bulk of an afternoon, but it also serves as a reminder that only in its tauter, wrenching stage form can Wicked , like a handprint on your heart, really leave you changed for good. Loud and Clear Joseph Tomastik &gt; Wicked: For Good takes many huge swings but misses in baffling fashion, making for a technically impressive but disappointing conclusion to the Wicked story. By all accounts, this is the much more difficult half of the story to pull off, as it’s where the musical in particular gets much denser and incorporates many more direct elements from The Wizard of Oz . Unfortunately, that difficulty rears its ugly head in Wicked: For Good . As ambitious as this movie is for tackling already unwieldy source material, those ambitions ultimately don’t pay off. RogerEbert Christy Lemire \ 3 / 4 &gt;If it sounds like this second half is darker than the first, it is, but it’s also more effective in its consistency of tone. “Wicked” was all fun and games until it wasn’t, and that sudden shift was jarring. In “For Good,” we know from the start that we’re in more serious territory with the deep strings of John Powell’s score as Ozian workers build the Yellow Brick Road. Erivo and Grande find just the right amount of tenderness and sadness with “For Good,” and that bond between them shines bright once more. Poignant and intimate, it’s a legitimate tearjerker. Bring tissues. AwardsWatch Sophia Ciminello \ 'C ' &gt;Despite stellar work from Erivo and Grande, Wicked: For Good can’t justify its existence as its own separate outing. Even with a pair of new songs and a deeper exploration of some of the musical’s beloved characters, the runtime feels bloated and bogged down by Chu’s constant attempts to make this a movie of the moment and to remind audiences of the connection they had to the first film. Simply put, Chu does not add enough new material to make this film feel like much more than a studio cash grab. There’s certainly still magic to be found in the movie for those who are seeking it, but when the credits finally roll, it’s difficult to say that Chu’s additions to this film have changed the world of Wicked for the better. The Guardian Peter Bradshaw \ 4 / 5 &gt;It’s tangled and a bit bewildering; but then so is the original film, in which we never know whether to believe in the Wizard’s final benediction. But what a performance from Erivo; it is genuinely moving when the Prince has to convince Elphaba what we, the audience, have always known: that she is beautiful. FilmHounds Paul Klein &gt;Erivo, Grande and Bailey are all fantastic once again, and allowed to deepen the characters more and show the complexities of them, while also remaining true to why people love them so much. It's a shame that the rest of the cast are given short shrift. Ethan Slater and Marissa Bode have the rumblings of a more interesting subplot that doesn't really go anywhere as much as it should. Even so, and despite its more frantic nature, Wicked: For Good continues to lovingly taking a look at what it means to be a rebel against dictatorships, how people will lie to you to get what they want, and how you must remain true to yourself at all times. It's not so much that the film is disappointing, that would be too harsh a criticism. It's that the film is merely as good as it could be, given what the stage show offers. It wraps things up, but there's no feeling of cohesion – something that was never going to be in Chu's hands, and for what he has, he excels at. Independent Clarisse Loughrey \ 2 / 5 &gt;For Good has little sense of movement, literally or emotionally – no profound revelations, no wonder or spectacle. All that’s to be done now is for each character to process, via standardised ballad, what they’ve learned.",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings

I’m probably gonna get downvoted but I did NOT like Wicked : for good,"I feel like I’m asking to get flagged for this, but I genuinely did not like Wicked Part 2, and it’s not because of the acting, or the singing, or the production. In fact, let me be very clear: Everything technical about the movie is stunning. The cinematography? Beautiful. The music? Gorgeous. The cast? They need Oscars ASAP. The vocals, the staging, the worldbuilding visuals? All top tier. And I’m saying this as someone who is obsessed with Wicked Part 1, like, Part 1 is my favorite movie ever. It was the first film I watched in theaters, I’ve rewatched it a ridiculous number of times, and it still makes me cry. Part 1 is magical, emotional, tightly written, and incredibly satisfying. Wicked : For good is the opposite. Not because of the performances. Not because of the production. But because the story is jus bad. I’m sorry, but it is, and I don’t even think this is a super unpopular opinion, especially among people who are new to Wicked. The Wizard of Oz shoehorning is painful,the constant need to align with Wizard of Oz plot points drags the story down. Part 1 stands on its own, it’s fresh, it has a clear emotional arc, and Elphaba’s journey feels powerful. Part 2 suddenly becomes a checklist of references, and it feels forced, messy, and anticlimactic. Every character arc feels unsatisfying, In Part 1, you see Elphaba rise, fail, learn, sacrifice, and evolve. You want her to become this powerful leader, maybe a protector of Animals, maybe a revolutionary, the potential is huge. In Part 2, everything collapses into nothing. • Elphaba never gets a moment of true strategic power. • Fiyero’s fate feels tragic for no meaningful reason. • Glinda becomes the “pretty face” leader in a way that makes sense narratively but still feels hollow. • The Wizard storyline is just frustrating, not compelling, and his ending is pure shit . And yes, I get the realism: No good deed goes unpunished, but there’s a difference between “realistic tragedy” and “emotionally unsatisfying storytelling,” and Part 2 falls into the latter. Elphaba’s choices make no sense, she has more magical ability than literally anyone in Oz, and this is what she accomplishes? She has no tact, no long game, no attempt at political maneuvering. She keeps sabotaging herself by being emotional in situations where she needed to be strategic. Honestly, Glinda’s whole “play nice in public, do the real shit behind the scenes” approach would’ve served Elphaba better, but instead, Elphaba jumps straight into maximum chaos mode and then wonders why it goes badly. Also, the magic lore feels contradictory, Elphaba is the only one with “real” magic but Madame Morrible also has magic and Nessa can read the Grimmerie. sometimes the words are sacred only for Elphaba but also not and at the end it's implied thst glinda now can do magic, it’s just confusing. I know this isn’t the film’s fault because it’s adapting the musical, but the inconsistencies feel more obvious in a movie. I just don’t get it, why does the Wizard get to escape? Madam Morrible was literally his lackey. They were both terrible, sure, but he was the architect of everything: the lies, the frauds, the prejudice, the entire machinery of Anima. He’s the one who set it all in motion. Yet somehow she gets jailed while he just slips away into the shadows? It’s pathetic, honestly. If she deserved punishment, then he deserved it ten times over. He was the main force; she was just the obedient hand carrying out his rot. The ending feels weak because it lets the real villain walk. Bôq’s story was fine, The Tin Man arc was the one part of Part 2 that felt coherent. His motivations made sense. His resentment made sense. It tracks emotionally, even without Wizard of Oz connections. Everything else? Messy. Part 1 stands as one of the best musicals/films ever made. It’s tight, emotional, dramatic, meaningful, visually stunning, musically perfect. You could build an entire expanded universe off the tone and direction of Part 1 ( think dune or star wars for the girls and the gays) Part 2, for all its visual and musical excellence, still has a story that feels weak, rushed, and frustrating. It’s not the movie’s fault; it’s the source material, but it still left me disappointed. I wanted to love it. I love everything else around it. But the story? The story killed it for me.

It is subtle, not a term that comes to mind when considering the joyful maximalism of the ""Wicked"" film.

There’s plenty of cause to rejoicify, notably the visual splendor, the charming central friendship and some pretty songs, notably “For Good."" Caroline Siede, Girl Culture (Substack) While For Good wants to be a movie that inspires audiences to dig deep into its darker political allegories, ironically, it’s best enjoyed if you’re willing to turn off your brain and just get swept along in its emotions. B Naveen Kumar, Washington Post Despite its packed agenda, the film can also feel meandering and directionless. 2/4 Manohla Dargis, New York Times Even so, from its director to its cast, the movie is a testament to diversity (species included) as a common good as well as to love, friendship and solidarity. It’s on the side of kindness, which is itself, well, a balm. Aisha Harris, NPR This installment is far from a total misfire thank goodness Erivo and Grande are such captivating performers perfectly suited to these roles but the over padding and stuffing meant to justify this bifurcated packaging soon becomes readily apparent. Wendy Ide, Observer (UK) There is a crucial ingredient missing: humour. Without it, the spark is extinguished; the astringency that cut through the sentimentality of the first picture is gone. Peter Howell, Toronto Star It is darker, denser and in many ways more interesting than its predecessor, though newcomers should beware: entering Oz here without context is like being dropped into a tornado. 3/4 Johnny Oleksinski, New York Post Director Jon M. Chu shoots it with tender simplicity and just lets the pair connect and feel. He wisely shows much more restraint in Part Two. 3/4 Wenlei Ma, The Nightly (AU) Wicked For Good lacks the dynamism and energy of its predecessor. Without the razzle dazzle seduction and distraction double punch of the first part’s many, big, all in numbers, it falls flat much of the time. 2.5/5 Katie Walsh, Tribune News Service As it turns out, ""Wicked"" is not too big to fail. In fact, it may be all the excess baggage that weighs down the second installment, making it impossible for the sequel ""Wicked: For Good"" to defy gravity. 2/4 Carla Meyer, San Francisco Chronicle It holds too much space for trite dialogue, obvious special effects and pointless skirmishes between green skinned animal rights advocate Elphaba and the corrupt Oz administration — and too little for the story’s key relationships. 2/4 Donald Clarke, Irish Times If you bought the first film’s brash visual aesthetic – the result of a giant toddler vomiting candyfloss all over Walt Disney World – then you will be relieved to discover it has got no less stomach unsettling. 2/5 Kristen Lopez, The Film Maven Wicked: For Good sticks the landing as best as it can. When Erivo and Grande are finally together, it does leave ""a handprint on your heart"" even if everything leading up to it is just drawing that out. B Odie Henderson, Boston Globe The follow up to director Jon M. Chu’s massive 2024 hit is more of the same, only darker. The dark elements are written into the show’s second act, which even fans would agree is not as good as the first. 2/4 Matt Singer, ScreenCrush As the lyrics of the title song suggest, a change for good does not necessarily mean a change for the better. 6/10 Amy Nicholson, Los Angeles Times The first installment was all tedious set up. The second has a body count. John Nugent, Empire Magazine Not quite over the rainbow, then, but just enough of its colours and candour to get by. 3/5 Jake Coyle, Associated Press I rarely found myself lifted into a movie world, but rather sat watching it sometimes with admiration, rarely with delight from the mezzanine. The rub of going for maximum effect all the time is that the actors never have a chance to simply be. 2/4 Brian Truitt, USA Today Even with an overcomplicated ending and a couple of character development nitpicks, you couldn't ask for a more ""Wicked"" closer. 3.5/4 Caryn James, BBC.com \ This film is as slick and shiny as Glinda's lip gloss, but it may also be just what its many fans want. 4/5 Sandra Hall, Sydney Morning Herald No doubt the fans will thrill to the music all over again, but the impact is lost when every song seems to be straining to be a showstopper. 3.5/5 Tim Grierson, Screen International Ultimately director Jon M. Chu’s more is more approach has a numbing effect, the endless spectacle leaving little room for nuance, depth or genuine feeling. India Block, London Evening Standard Everything is stitched together beautifully to create an exhilarating piece of movie musical magic that re invents the Golden Age. 5/5 Robbie Collin, Daily Telegraph (UK) What makes it so frustrating is that director Jon M Chu is an established musicals master; his In the Heights is a modern classic of the form. But the corporate stretch it out and wring it dry approach here has been deadening. 1/5 Clarisse Loughrey, Independent (UK) For Good has little sense of movement, literally or emotionally – no profound revelations, no wonder or spectacle. All that’s to be done now is for each character to process, via standardised ballad, what they’ve learned. 2/5 Radheyan Simonpillai, Globe and Mail Like Fruit Loops that had been left sitting in a bowl of milk for too long – those bright solid colours bleeding out and leaving nothing but a soggy mess. Christy Lemire, RogerEbert.com \ The songs may not be as catchy this time around, but 'Wicked: For Good’ really sings where it counts: with the emotional ache of the fractured friendship at the story’s core. 3/4 David Fear, Rolling Stone Yet the sensation of a work that, in translation from one medium to another, no longer defies gravity but sort of roughly plummets back down to terra firma can’t easily be shaken off. Alonso Duralde, The Film Verdict Wicked fans can delight in one final visit to Oz, while those of us less enamored can hope that the yellow brick road ends here. For good. Rafer Guzman, Newsday Fans may find the movie serviceable enough, but others may find it underwhelmifying. 2.5/4 Kevin Maher, The Times (UK) They’ve only gone and done it. The makers of this musical sequel have delivered a film that surpasses last year’s box office smash in verve, ambition and emotional ache. 4/5 Peter Bradshaw, Guardian What a performance from Erivo; it is genuinely moving when the Prince has to convince Elphaba what we, the audience, have always known: that she is beautiful. 4/5 Billie Melissa, Newsweek Its sincerity, heart, and belief in a better world are inspiring, and Grande and Erivo deliver the message flawlessly, bringing us into their warm embrace to comfort and inspire. Peter Debruge, Variety The film fixes a common complaint of the show, giving the pair more scenes (and songs) together in this final stretch, which now feels like a robust tale unto itself. Bilge Ebiri, New York Magazine/Vulture It brings the Wicked cycle to a surprisingly satisfying conclusion, at least for now. William Bibbiani, TheWrap There hasn’t been a pre planned 'Part Two' this disappointing since the second half of Andy Muschietti’s 'It.' At least nobody projectile vomits on Jeff Goldblum to the tune of Juice Newton’s 'Angel of the Morning.' Danny Leigh, Financial Times It makes a neat takeaway for two bold, impressive movies, whose biggest achievement is to have (mostly) made their own complexity look simple. 3/5 David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter Grande floods it with so much feeling that it humanizes and enriches the character and, by extension, the whole movie. Linda Marric, HeyUGuys It’s a soaring musical triumph filled with standout performances, extraordinary craft, and an emotional core that is sure to delight fans young and old. 5/5 Kate Erbland, IndieWire The things that missed the mark the first time, well, they still do. The things that worked in “Wicked”? They still do, but only a clock tick better. B Liz Shannon Miller, Consequence For Good doesn’t sell Elphaba’s decree that ""no good deed will I do again,"" one of the movie’s many muddled moments. It does, however, reflect an age where every message feels muddled, no hero can be trusted. All we know is that something is rotten here. B Dan Rubins, Slant Magazine The film is stretched out, breathless, and never really emotionally affecting, even on the level of nostalgia. 2.5/4 SYNOPSIS: And now whatever way our stories end, I know you have rewritten mine by being my friend… Last year’s global cinematic cultural sensation, which became the most successful Broadway film adaptation of all time, now reaches its epic, electrifying, emotional conclusion in Wicked: For Good. Directed once again by award winning director Jon M. Chu and starring the spectacular returning cast, led by Academy Award® nominated superstars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, the final chapter of the untold story of the witches of Oz begins with Elphaba and Glinda estranged and living with the consequences of their choices. Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), now demonized as The Wicked Witch of the West, lives in exile, hidden within the Ozian forest while continuing her fight for the freedom of Oz’s silenced Animals and desperately trying to expose the truth she knows about The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum). Glinda, meanwhile, has become the glamorous symbol of Goodness for all of Oz, living at the palace in Emerald City and reveling in the perks of fame and popularity. Under the instruction of Madame Morrible (Oscar® winner Michelle Yeoh), Glinda is deployed to serve as an effervescent comfort to Oz, reassuring the masses that all is well under the rule of The Wizard. As Glinda’s stardom expands and she prepares to marry Prince Fiyero (Olivier award winner and Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey) in a spectacular Ozian wedding, she is haunted by her separation from Elphaba. She attempts to broker a conciliation between Elphaba and The Wizard, but those efforts will fail, driving Elphaba and Glinda only further apart. The aftershocks will transform Boq (Tony nominee Ethan Slater) and Fiyero forever, and threaten the safety of Elphaba’s sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), when a girl from Kansas comes crashing into all their lives. As an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, Glinda and Elphaba will need to come together one final time. With their singular friendship now the fulcrum of their futures, they will need to truly see each other, with honesty and empathy, if they are to change themselves, and all of Oz, for good.

"Ariana Grande in a vintage 1950s demi couture gown at ""Wicked: For Good"" after party in Mayfair, London. Sourced from Amarcord Vintage Fashion. Styled by Law Roach.","Dress description: Vintage 1950s gown. This breathtaking dress is made to couture standards and the details are absolutely to die for. Tiered, pleated tulle layered over two more layers of tulle, all atop a layered and structured taffeta full skirt. Strapless, ruched tulle bodice layered over taffeta and then lined in silk. Nipped waist makes the bodice fitted and enhances the full skirt silhouette. Zip closure at the backside that is then concealed with a row of buttons. Attached to the bodice is a sheer layer of tulle that is like a reverse cape, which buttons at the back of the neck and is open beyond that. You can leave it hanging or tie it at the back of the waist to allow for arm movement. And if it couldn't get better than that, all of this is adorned with handmade, pale pinkish white flowers, trimmed and centered in black velvet. Surprisingly, there is no label within, but trust us when we say that this dress is a masterpiece and is made to the levels of all of the greatest 1950s couturiers like Balenciaga, Balmain, Jacques Fath, and more.",Cast Performance/Acting/Actor Discussion

‘Wicked: For Good’ First Reactions Thread,"Please share any reactions you find in the comments below Last years reactions to ‘Wicked’ Clayton Davis WickedForGood flies high. Jon M. Chu helms an emotionally timely piece that deepens every spell cast by the first film. No surprise, Cynthia Erivo &amp; Ariana Grande are SPECTACULAR (again). You're NOT ready for the “For Good” duet. A heartfelt end to Oz’s greatest friendship. David Gordon “If Wicked part one was faithful to the blueprint of the stage, Wicked: For Good builds out the world to create a full and different (but the same) and extremely emotional version of act 2. It’s a thrill ride and a heartbreaker and it’s sexy and everything you want it to be.” Kobi Kassal Bring your tissues and watch out cause Ariana Grande is gonna win??! that Oscar. Jazz Tangcay Get ready because WickedForGood exceeds all expectations. Jon M. Chu is a genius in the way he brings this to a close. Elphaba and Glinda’s stories are expanded, and leave you with an emotional gut punch at the end. Cynthia Erivo is magnificent, but get ready for Ariana Grande as she takes this performance to the next level and is a tour de force. And wow, the world building, the costumes, and Alice Brooks’ cinematography deserve your attention. Can not wait to see it again. I sobbed hard. Wicked: For Good is sheer musical greatness. Destiny Jackson All Good Deeds Go Rewarded in Wicked: For Good. It’s an epic and heartbreakingly tender conclusion to one of the most dynamic friendships in pop culture history. There’s a lot for fans of the Broadway show to love with butterfly kiss sized surprises in store. With some reservations that I carried over from the Act 2 Stage Show to Wicked: For Good, I’m happy to report that… SOMEHOW I’VE FALLEN UNDER Jon M. Chu’s spell. He managed to make Elphaba and Glinda’s friendship more vulnerable and powerful. Ariana Grande’s soaring turn as the girl in the bubble is an emotionally complex tightrope that she balances effortlessly as she tries oscillating between the Good Witch’s need for perfection and the struggle for Glinda’s agency. Cynthia Erivo continues to imbue her gravity defying powers from Wicked Pt 1 and channel them into a new intensity of care, passion and frustration bringing to life an Elphaba that has had enough of that Emerald City bullshit! Full of love for her friend and for the place she calls her home, Erivo lights Elphaba’s verve on fire expanding more of the character than before. Jonathan Bailey continues as the heartthrob of a lifetime in Wicked: For Good. His performance as the playboy w/ a dislike for all things nerd ifying is a real no brainer . He digs deep to show just how much encountering the witch of his heart’s desire can change a man for good. Chris Murphy Saw wicked for good last month and believe me when i say that it expands and deepens the original source material in generally exciting and innovative ways. Cynthia and Ari take their performances to the next level with jaw dropping performances. The film fully sticks the landing",Reviews/Reactions/Feelings
