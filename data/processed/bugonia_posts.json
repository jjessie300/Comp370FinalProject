    "selftext": "Bugonia, which seems to have quite the variety of interpretations with its artistic production only has one real meaning. This movie is produced as a sort of inside joke referencing Emma Stone's desire to cut shave her head, as she prefers it, and finally getting her to admit doing so makes her appear like an alien to some of her close friends in real life. This movie is a gag and parody that is made with a high quality production and cast all to joke about Emma cutting her hair. Personally I think it is a beautiful movie as I can see the fun the actors had creating this film and the intricate humor layered in the script and acting.\n\n  \nEDIT: Don is actually never filmed with anyone else in the room. The easiest place to spot this is at 47:50 -&gt; Don is greenscreened in when walking to assure Teddy after the breakdown in the car. He's not actually in the same scene as Teddy.",

    "selftext": "*\"You can't beat me because you are a loser and I'm a winner and that's fucking life!\" - Michelle, Bugonia*\n\nI just finished Bugonia and honestly, I’m still a little conflicted about it, in a very Yorgos Lanthimos way. One thing that stood out immediately was the unusual 1.50:1 aspect ratio, which I’ve basically never seen used for a streaming release. The black sidebars made most my screen feel dead, but at the same time the film probably would’ve looked even stranger stretched out to a standard 1.78:1 release.\n\nWhat I enjoyed was the look and feel of the movie. The bright colors, odd designs, abstract sets, and alien environments all felt like classic Yorgos imagination. Some of the frame compositions were genuinely beautiful. The score mostly stays in the background, occasionally stepping forward to sharpen the tension, though I honestly found it weaker than composer's work in Poor Things.\n\nEmma Stone delivers, and Jesse Plemons is doing career best stuff right now. This might even be his strongest performance yet. And yes, the hype about Emma shaving her head for the role didn’t go much to waste as I thought, she delivered.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the movie was the mental-chess dynamic between Teddy and Michelle. Teddy keeps pushing, adjusting his approach, cornering her psychologically in small, while Michelle is trying to stay three steps ahead, even though she knows Teddy is circling closer and closer to the truth. Their back-and-forth feels like a game without rules, but with real stakes. It’s subtle but interesting to watch. I also liked the \"Save the Green Planet!\" theme, this feels like Yorgos' own take on it.\n\nThe final reveal was exactly the kind of thing I expected from Yorgos, something bizarre, mythic, and strangely funny.\n\nWhat I’m stuck on is the rating. I floated between 3.5 and 4 the whole time. I liked it a lot, even admired parts of it, but I didn’t love it the way I thought I'd do.\n\n**Rating:** 4/5 (but honestly feels like a 3.75 to me)",

Whether it’s pesticides or something else, Bugonia wants us to see ourselves in Teddy. Fiercely appealing to hierarchy in assigning blame for whatever societal or personal ill we are experiencing. Be it a tech CEO, an Alien or a God, we never seek an answer which could be an ‘amalgamation’ of misunderstood lower level factors but that we demand a singular vector through which to filter our wrath and frustration.\n\nWe always seek to understand those above us in the hierarchy but it is NEVER in reverse. In the same way that the Aliens tried to ‘guide’ and preserve life to some extent in a “global” sense, they cannot understand the actual nuances of what our needs are nor do they care (Teddy’s mother). We can no more understand a tech CEO or a God than a Bee colony can understand Teddy's motives as a bee keeper.\n\nI feel like the biggest statement this film makes is that blame seeking, EVEN IF you are completely right about your intuitions never results in a good solution. It’ll always end up as antifreeze in our veins. We as a society will always seek to blame and find restitution in higher powers / entities which cannot understand our grievances nor do they care about our individual suffering.",

Much like Eddie Bravo and other really in too far conspiracy theorists have said for years now. I think this is a really fun discussion, and would like to engage with actual conspiracy theorists here that believe in flat earth and no space theory. How closely did this movie get to these theories? What was the same and different? \n\nIve also been an ancient astronaut theorist since i was like 16. And this also played into that. \n\nAnyway, super good movie, and id love to discuss any thoughts on its conspiratorial subject matter. \n\nSide note: Really well done in the woke/not woke/normal movie regard.

    "selftext": "**BEST PICTURE**\n\nBefore we delve into CCA and Globe noms, I still feel comfortable with OBAA as our frontrunner with Hamnet and Sinners as my spoilers, 4-7 seem like solid bets. Let’s talk Wicked since it’s not the lock I thought pre-embargo, with reviews being less enthusiastic overall, there’s a valid argument about it missing the 10. I’ll keep it in purely off of box office, crafts and Erivo &amp; Grande for but I would have it in the 8-12 range. No Other Choice stays in and rounding out my 10, I have The Testament of Ann Lee off of Seyfried and techs.\n\n\n\n**DIRECTING**\n\nI still have PTA winning even if One Battle doesn’t take Picture, I feel confident about Zhao and Panahi, with the last 2 slots being a shuffle of Coogler, Safdie and Trier. With how Sinners is positioned, I feel comfortable about Coogler placing but not locked by any means. Other contenders that are dark horses for noms I think include Guillermo del Toro, Mona Fastvold and Kleber Mendonça Filho.\n\n\n\n**LEAD ACTRESS**\n\nAs of late, this category has boiled down to Buckley winning with spots 2-5 up for grabs. Reinsve seems solid for the nom, same applies for Seyfried. Let’s talk about Cynthia Erivo, before the embargo, I moved her up to number 2 viewing her as a possible dark horse to Buckley, now I think she’s fighting for a spot. I’ll keep her in for now since I still have Wicked in my Picture lineup but if it falls out or she loses the Globe to either Seyfried or Byrne, she could miss to Chase Infiniti or even Emma Stone. Unless Song Sung Blue is like Nyad, Hudson’s ain’t happening.\n\n\n\n**LEAD ACTOR**\n\nI don’t have as much to say on this category. With Marty Supreme continuing to warm up in reactions, I still have Chalamet taking it with DiCaprio as my alternative based on his film’s strength. Hawke’s looking solid for the nomination, I won’t rule him out as a potential threat but only if Blue Moon overperforms, feel comfortable about Moura and Jordan. Other contenders I won’t rule out would be Clooney, Byung-hun, Plemons or Edgerton.\n\n\n\n**SUPPORTING ACTRESS**\n\nThis category gives me an aneurysm. I think Grande could win based on what she’s doing (plus a little category fraud doesn’t hurt) but only if Wicked stays in Picture. Moving Teyana Taylor to the top is not something I feel confident in but I have her as One Battle’s acting win, with the comparisons to Mahershala Ali in Moonlight compelling me for now. If I had my way, Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas would be our front runner with how open this field is, anyone could take it, hell I won’t rule out Amy Madigan or even Glenn Close at this rate.\n\n\n\n**SUPPORTING ACTOR**\n\nOf the 4 acting categories, I have the least to say. Mescal, Penn and Skarsgård are your locks dooking it out for the win, with the remaining spots being a shuffle of del Toro, Elordi and Sandler. I’ll lean Benicio based on him coattailing Penn and being the character audiences respond to the most, and Elordi with the amount of mentions he’s gotten but if Jay Kelly returned into my Picture 10, Sandler could take his spot.\n\n\n\n**ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY**\n\nFor now, I have Sinners winning as Coogler’s consolation prize although Sentimental Value and It Was Just an Accident are in the mix. Marty Supreme is looking pretty good for the nomination, and rounding out my 5 is Jay Kelly as it’s lone nom but I’ll acknowledge it could very easily be a Best Picture staple. Please nominate Sorry, Baby and I won’t shut up for months but other possibilities aside from that would probably be Testament of Ann Lee, The Secret Agent, Blue Moon and maybe Weapons or Is This Thing On? but we’ll see.\n\n\n\n**ADAPTED SCREENPLAY**\n\nOne Battle and Hamnet are locked with the other three spots looking up for grabs. Since I have No Other Choice in Picture, this checks out here, I’ll keep on Bugonia for now but it's nowhere near a lock here and my one hot take is Wake Up Dead Man misses out for Train Dreams as its lone nomination. Bentley and Kwedar are fresh off nominations for Sing Sing last year and if Netflix campaigns it right, that could play a factor here. Frankenstein is an outside shot but the only ATL shot it looks good for would be Supporting Actor, I don’t see Wicked happening and if you would like to entertain NEON revives Life of Chuck here, let me know below.\n\n",

    "selftext": "I finally watched “It Was Just An Accident” this evening - it was very good - but the first thought that crossed my mind as I was heading home was “Hmm, this film has been showing up as #6 or #7 on most people’s predictions for best picture nominees, and yet I’m not sure it’s going to make it. \n\nFor It:  \n•Won the Palm D’Or at the Cannes Film Festival, which immediately puts it on voters radar and they’re likely going to watch it.   \n•Compelling Narrative: Director Jafar Panahi has had a tough relationship with the Iranian government, and the film was made under challenging circumstances.   \n•With the evolved membership of the AAMPAS, more international films are getting best picture nominations (2 in 2025, 3 in 2024, 1 in 2023, 1 in 2022).   \n•Neon is going to push hard for this film, and for the director. \n•The film is considered one of Panahi’s most accessible films. \n\nAgainst it:  \n•Let’s face it. It’s a very crowded field of films vying to get into the best picture 10. If we assume that 5 slots are already taken (Hamnet, OBAA, Sinners, Marty Supreme, Sentimental Value) this leaves 5 slots for at least 8 film to fight over (Frankenstein, Wicked, Jay Kelly, Bugonia, Train Dreams, No Other Choice, It Was Just An Accident, The Secret Agent, Is This Thing On?, The House of Dynamite, Weapons, F1)   \n•Neon has 5 films it’s trying to promote this season. Five! Its top priority is Sentimental Value, and then it has 4 foreign language films that are strong contenders for the international film category. IWJAA could get lost in the shuffle?\n•There are 4 strong international films that are trying to get a best picture nomination: Sentimental Value, IWJAA, No Other Choice, and The Secret Agent. Wouldn’t the votes get spread out and this may hurt their chances? Could it mean IWJAA gets an international film nomination but gets left out of best picture?  \n•While critically praised for its depth, the film's specific political commentary and philosophical implications may not connect with a wide enough range of Academy voters compared to films with broader, more accessible themes. Sentimental Value, for example, covers a very global theme of family relations. Much more widely accessible. \n\nI currently have the film at number 11 in my predictions. \nHow about you? \n",

    "selftext": "I watched in theaters the day it came out and I enjoyed it. \n\nI then wanted to watch it again but my local theater said it performed poorly and no one was buying tickets so they got rid of it to make way for Running Man and Wicked so I waited until today since it was just released on streaming.\n\nAnyways, I watch it today without the subtitles on and during the scene towards the end when she is back on her mothership with her kind there were no subtitles at all and honestly I prefer it that way. With the subtitles on all she and her kind discuss are how they couldn't reach her since she didn't have hair anymore and that a decision must be made in regards to the humans fate. \n\nSince I didn't watch it with subtitles tonight I forgot what they originally said and I think it plays so much better. They talk in their language and she is upset and ultimately takes that pointy chopstick/wand thing and pops the earths bubble and all humans die.\n\nThe dialogue she and her kind have are not 100% vital to understanding what happens next and how the film ends. I think it plays much, much better this way.",

However, if you wanna run the easter egg in BO7 zombies or get up to some shenanigans in PEAK, I'm always down!\n\nI also have a ton of other co-op games that I'd be down to play like Buckshot Roulette, The Forest, Pico Park, PlateUp, Portal, Raft, R.E.P.O, ROUNDS, RV There Yet?, Stardew Valley, Tricky Towers, Ultimate Chicken Horse, etc. But just a heads up, there's a lot of games in that list that I either haven't played yet or just haven't played in a long time 😭 I'm also down to get more games later this week since Steam will have a ton of games on sale because of Black Friday!\n\nObligatory, we don't always have to game either. I'm getting back in the groove of watching movies and tv shows. I'm currently watching Welcome to Derry (amazing btw), but I also plan to watch films Bugonia or OBAA, so I'm always down to watch something too!",

While a lot of people don't care about box office results, the truth is that if you want to see more of these movies, vote with your wallet, and if anyone wants to have a long, vital career as a filmmaker, the film in question has to become a certified box office hit.",

    "selftext": "I am currently sick and therefore have too much time on my hands, so here is my predictions for these two groups.\n\n**AFI Top 10**\n\n- Avatar: Fire and Ash\n- Bugonia\n- Frankenstein\n- Hamnet\n- Marty Supreme\n- One Battle After Another\n- Sentimental Value\n- Sinners\n- Train Dreams\n- Weapons\n\nCommentary: Weapons is giving a A Quiet Plave where it performs really here and gets like a PGA nomination. They nominated Emilia Perez because of Zoe Saldana and Selena Gomez, so I assume Sentimental Value gets in here because of Elle Fanning. \n\nAlternate pick is probably Jay Kelly. My prediction is that Wicked *will* miss here and that will wake the last people up to the reality that this is vulnerable in Best Picture.\n\n...\n\n**National Board of Review**\n\n- WINNER: One Battle After Another\n\nTop 10\n- Frankenstein\n- Hamnet\n- A House of Dynamite\n- Is This Thing On?\n- Jay Kelly\n- Marty Supreme\n- No Other Choice\n- Sinners\n- Train Dreams\n- Wicked: For Good\n\nCommentary: Who knows with this group. Last year they had their worst Oscar overlap ever with only four films crossing over to Best Picture from their 11 mentions. As an Oscar precursor this group means truly nothing. I am just having fun here and throwing darts.\n\nOBAA fits very well with their past winners: a big budget action film, Warner Bros and a well-known director they've actually rewarded before. Sinners would be my strong alternative pick.\n\nRegarding noms, A House of Dynamite just feels like something they would do given their tastes. Sometimes they throw in random indies here, hence my Is This Thing On? mention. They do NOT like International films, the only ones that got nominated from recent years are The Boy and the Heron and RRR. So against my better judgement I'm going with No Other Choice.",

That is not really a scary movie but I imagine it'd be scary in Imax. Yesterday I watched Bugonia in normal cinema that freaked me out but I could TOLERATE it. Would watching shining in Imax be the same level of scary as Bugonia in normal cinema? Salam Alaykum",

Due to it's current buzz based on reported screenings it has the potential to be a major contender (hence, my placement of it in Picture, Screenplay, and as the Alternate Pick in Lead Actor) but I still think it's a bit early to have it winning any major prizes. Come December however, this could very easily change.\n\nCurrently, I just don't see it winning anything major due to the sheer strength of not just One Battle After Another, but Sinners.\n\nI've viewed both films on two occasions throughout the year, and strongly believe that aside from Hamnet, they will be this year's primary contenders: with Warner Bros pushing OBAA in ATL categories to synergise with PTA's narrative and its status as the BP frontrunner, and pushing Sinners in BTL categories to capitalise on its technical aspects, in addition to Original Screenplay, to increase Coogler's chances of an Oscar win.\n\nAdditionally, I have the trio of OBAA, Hamnet and Sinners dominating the Acting Categories. Having recently rewatched Sinners, I believe it makes more sense for Warner Bros to give more of a balanced push to both film's performances, rather than going all in for the unlikely chance of OBAA recieving a record breaking 6 nominations ([which I speculated upon the other day](https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/1p45l6n/could_one_battle_after_another_do_the_thing/)). Therefore, I have Mosaku and Lindo in the slots I previously had predicted for Hall and Del Toro, as much as I love the latter two.\n\nIt's simply more balanced and logical. As many of you pointed out, while Hall and Del Toro's performances are strong, they are relatively brief and a little one-note. After rewatching Sinners yesterday, I feel that Mosaku and Lindo's performances have better nomination chances: not only do they have more screentime, but I feel their film provides stronger showcases of their acting ability than OBAA does for Hall and Del Toro.\n\nNow onto the Acting Winners and Song before I wrap things up. Like I said, I'm not putting all my faith in Marty until I've seen it, or the film's wide reviews are released. Therefore, I have Leonardo winning his second Best Actor Oscar, with Chalamet in second place, although Chalamet may gain the push he needs if Marty's buzz is strong enough come December. (Emphasis on may, as I strongly believe OBAA's momentum could bring Leo over the line regardless, it's just that strong). Similarly, due to Wicked's middling reception (for an awards contendor) combined with the sequel curse, I have Teyana Taylor as the Supporting Actress frontrunner. Her screentime is short for a win contendor, but it's looking like a Mahershala Ali in Moonlight situation to me.\n\nIn all, I believe OBAA is just too strong to go home empty handed in the Acting Categories, so Leo or Teyana winning (if not both of them) is just a no-brainer. I don't Chase Infiniti winning BA against Jessie Buckley, and Stellan Skarsgard's overdue narrative is honestly too good to pass up: as a matter of fact, I believe his biggest threat is Paul Mescal rather than Sean Penn (due to Hamnet's strength and Penn's two previous wins), so I may move Penn to 3rd and Mescal to 2nd in the future).\n\nFinally, song is the most interesting category to me. Whilst I have Golden at number one, as a Let it Go type winner, it could certianly be overtaken by I Lied to You based on how much the Academy loves Sinners. Honestly? I wouldn't be mad either way. I love both songs, and to be honest, the best case scenario in this category for me personally (while it's unlikely) is a tie between the two. I don't see it happening, but you never know I guess.\n\nI really hope my yapping hasn't bored any of you to death, or broken any rules this place might have about overlong posts. Do tell me what you think, and as this is my first predictions, I'm very open to criticism. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.",

    "title": "My First/Final 83rd Golden Globe Nomination Predictions (November 2025)",
    "selftext": "Predictions may tend to change.\n\nRecently following my 98th Oscar predictions not long ago, I was hoping to share my first 83rd Golden Globe predictions for 2026 (I will not be making another prediction post for both Oscars and Golden Globes for about three weeks after this one to comply with community rules). With the 83rd Golden Globe nominations announcement nearing on December 8, 2025, which would be almost two weeks from now, I would consider these 83rd Golden Globe nomination predictions I'm listing below my first and final predictions before the nominations are announced on December 8th.

Chase not gonna get in, I'm rooting for Kate Hudson to get in, but Julia, Tessa, Sydney will not make it obviously but they're still showing up to all the red carpet, roundtables to try to make the most of it.",

The CGI was awful at times. The whole point of these movies were made to have a few moments where you go \"omg! Dorothy, the yellow road, omg tin boy, omg red shoe\". \nA character dies by getting a house cycloned on top of them.\nWhen I think about these movies I want to cause 10s of thousands of dollars of damage to my own property. \nThese films brought out a rage inside of me I didn't know was possible.

    "selftext": "I saw Bugonia in a Cinemark theater in the suburbs of Seattle on Halloween night, and there was a trailer/teaser for an anime that looked pretty cool. However, for the life of me, I cant remember the name. \n\nI feel like it was maybe a commercial for a new series on Netflix, maybe coming in 2026.  I remember there being a character with long hair (maybe white or wearing a white dress/robe) and a sword. I have some word salad ive associated with the trailer like ninja, demons or vampires, retribution or revenge. Its not the Demon Slayer movie or Scarlet. Any help is appreciated",

    "selftext": "Any other CT A-Listers notice this lately?\n\nLast night I went to see Bugonia in Danbury, and I noticed the overall sound was not only lower in volume, but something in the EQ or general surround field was off as if some folly/SFX was straight up missing as well. It was distracting enough that I walked out after 15 minutes.\n\nTonight, I tried to see The Running Man at the Stamford Landmark... surprise! Distractingly low volume yet again. I shouldn't be able to hear whispers from two rows down, but this indeed was the case. Also walked out after 15 minutes.\n\nI'm grateful that with A-List I can just walk out when the conditions aren't right with no sunk cost, but it's pretty annoying. I'm gonna assume it's an issue with AMCs in the state as I saw Reze Arc earlier this week in the Bronx and that sounded fine. Gonna double-up on Bugonia and Running Man somewhere in NY tomorrow to test my hypothesis.",

    "title": "The Definitive Analog 4K Master List: 65mm, VistaVision &amp; Technicolor Classics",
    "selftext": "Over the past weeks I spent a lot of time researching, comparing and digging deep into which 4K UHD releases are truly shot on analog film and which ones deliver the best visual quality. This list is the result of all that work!\n\nFilm does not record the image with pixels like digital cameras do. It captures light in a physical way on real material. When original camera negative is carefully restored and scanned in 4K, you suddenly see details that were always there but never visible on DVD or early Blu-ray.\n\nWhat sets these movies apart is how vividly the image seems to come alive on screen. The picture has real weight, richness and character. It feels genuinely cinematic rather than synthetic, with a natural rhythm and presence that many modern digital productions aim for but only rarely achieve.\n\nBelow is the list of true analog classics available on 4K UHD Disc:\n\n***65mm &amp; 70mm***\n\n*These films were shot on 65mm negative (approx. 4x the size of standard 35mm), offering arguably the highest fidelity in cinema history.*\n\n**Super Panavision 70**\n\n* Lawrence of Arabia\n* 2001: A Space Odyssey\n* My Fair Lady\n* West Side Story (1961)\n\n**Todd-AO**\n\n* The Sound of Music\n* PlayTime (1967) *(Coming Feb 2026 from Criterion)*\n\n**MGM Camera 65 / Ultra Panavision 70**\n\n* Ben-Hur (1959)\n\n**Superpanorama 70**\n\n* The Black Tulip\n* Flying Clipper\n\n***Technirama***\n\n*Anamorphic 8-Perf 35mm* Often confused with 70mm because of the \"Super Technirama 70\" marketing used for blow-up prints, this format actually runs 35mm film horizontally through the camera with an anamorphic squeeze. It yields an incredibly sharp image that rivals 65mm.\n\n* Spartacus\n* The Pink Panther (1963) *(Kino Lorber release)*\n\n***VistaVision***\n\n*Spherical 8-Perf 35mm Paramount’s answer to CinemaScope. Like Technirama, the film runs horizontally through the camera to create a double-sized negative, but it uses spherical lenses (no anamorphic squeeze) for incredible clarity and depth.*\n\n* Vertigo\n* The Ten Commandments\n* The Searchers\n* North by Northwest\n* To Catch a Thief\n* The Man Who Knew Too Much\n* Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\n* White Christmas\n* The Trouble with Harry\n* High Society\n* The Brutalist\n* Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) (Approx. 80% shot on VistaVision to preserve resolution for optical effects)\n* One Battle After Another *(upcoming release)*\n\n***Classic Technicolor***\n\n*Three-Strip &amp; Dye-Transfer Era These titles utilized the 3-strip Technicolor process (or successive exposure for animation), resulting in color separation and vibrancy that modern single-strip color cannot replicate.*\n\n* The Wizard of Oz\n* The Red Shoes\n* Singin’ in the Rain\n* The African Queen\n* Phantom of the Opera (1943)\n* Rope\n* The War of the Worlds (1953)\n* The Ladykillers (1955)\n* Shane\n* Saraband for Dead Lovers\n\n***Modern 65mm &amp; IMAX (Analog Capture in the Digital Era)***\n\n*These productions commit to shooting on large-format film. While some are hybrids mixing 35mm with IMAX, the large-format sequences represent the pinnacle of modern analog resolution.*\n\n*(I have made a detailed list about* [IMAX](https://www.reddit.com/r/4kbluray/comments/1p4lmxv/guide_true_imax_on_4k_uhd_blueray_the_definitive/)*.)*\n\n**Primarily 65mm / IMAX Capture**\n\n* Dunkirk (IMAX 65mm + Panavision System 65)\n* Tenet (IMAX 65mm + Panavision System 65)\n* Nope (IMAX 65mm + Panavision System 65)\n* Oppenheimer (IMAX 65mm + Panavision System 65)\n* Murder on the Orient Express (2017) (Panavision System 65)\n* Death on the Nile (2022) (Panavision System 65)\n* Sinners (IMAX 65mm + Ultra Panavision 70)\n\n**Hybrid 35mm + 65mm IMAX (Key sequences on large format)**\n\n* Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (Ultimate Edition) (Restored 4K switches aspect ratio for IMAX scenes)\n* The Dark Knight (The first feature to use IMAX film cameras)\n* The Dark Knight Rises (Over an hour of IMAX footage)\n* First Man (16mm/35mm drama that switches to stunning IMAX 65mm for the moon landing)\n* The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (Arena sequence shifts to IMAX ratio)\n* Interstellar\n* Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (The Burj Khalifa sequence is reference quality IMAX capture)\n* No Time To Die\n* Star Trek Into Darkness (Approx 30 mins of IMAX film)\n* Star Wars: The Force Awakens (Jakku escape sequence captured on IMAX)\n* Star Wars: The Last Jedi (Key space battles/Action sequences)\n* Wonder Woman 1984 (Opening sequence and finale)\n\n**IMAX Documentaries (Pure 15-perf 70mm)**\n\n*Often overlooked, these short films offer some of the highest fidelity analog images available on the format.*\n\n* Rocky Mountain Express (The reference disc for steam train enthusiasts)\n* Space Station (The first-ever 3D IMAX film in space; pure film capture)\n* Tornado Alley (Sean Casey’s 70mm camera inside the intercept vehicle)\n* Grand Canyon Adventure: River at Risk\n* Humpback Whales\n* Journey to the South Pacific\n* National Parks Adventure\n\n**IMAX Documentaries (Hybrid 15/70 + Digital)**\n\n*Mix of 15/70 IMAX and high-end digital cameras*\n\n* Dream Big: Engineering Our World\n* Flight of the Butterflies\n* Hidden Universe\n* Journey to Space\n* Aircraft Carrier: Guardian of the Seas\n* We, The Marines\n* Pandas (2018)\n\n**Historical Large Format (Non-IMAX)**\n\n* Apollo 11 (Scanned from original 65mm 5-perf and 70mm 10-perf NASA engineering footage. While not an IMAX release format, it is pure, high-fidelity analog.)\n\n**Special Mention**\n\nTron (1982)  Super Panavision 70 &amp; VistaVision While famous for CGI, the live-action elements were actually shot on 65mm and VistaVision. The new 4K disc comes from a massive 8K scan of these original elements, making it arguably the sharpest version of the film possible.\n\nAirport &amp; Far and Away Although shot on 65mm, the available 4K discs are scanned from 35mm reduction elements, effectively negating the resolution benefits of the large format.\n\n***Animation (Successive Exposure)***\n\n*Technically distinct from live-action 3-strip, but sourced from successive high-res negatives.*\n\n* Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n* Cinderella\n\nThis list is not about chasing numbers or slapping 4K labels on covers. When analog films are restored with care, they do not just look good for their age. They look **timeless**.\n\nCORRECTION: Patton (1970) is not yet available on 4K UHD. Apologies for the mistake. I have removed it from the list. I have also included Tron to the list. Bugonia (upcoming release). Added some other movies to the list.

Bugonia\n\nOkay, I know that literally no one on the face of the earth is predicting Yorgos Lanthimos to get into director, let alone for the movie to get into picture. But, I put a lot of thought into this, and I realized, the Academy tends to only nominate 1 director of a foreign film per year, *sometimes* 2. So it's safer not to predict Panahi because it's another foreign film. The reason I snubbed Panahi over Trier is because Sentimental Value has more strength as a film, because it is in contention for 4 acting noms, and a win for screenplay. As for the Wagner Moura snub, I think that the film *The Secret Agent* is not really in contention for anything except Actor and *maybe* Picture and/or screenplay. Whereas Bugonia is likely to get into Picture, Actress, Screenplay, and *probably* Cinematography (hopefully). So it makes more sense that Jesse Plemons could take Moura's slot, which is arguably the most vulnerable. And the reason I predicted a lot of technical wins plus Screenplay for Hamnet over OBAA is because I think that if the Academy goes with OBAA for Picture, Director, and Supporting Actor, they'll want to give Hamnet at least a few things more than just Actress. Anyways, everyone reading this probably deeply disagrees with me, so if you could explain why instead of just simply saying no, that'd be great!",
