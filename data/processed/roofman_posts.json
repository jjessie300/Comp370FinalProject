        "self_text": "Second edit to add: At the time of writing I had not seen the movie, but I did go see it opening day. I really liked it, and I appreciate the writer/director's vision, even if some aspects of the true story were altered or omitted. Absolutely worth a watch, no question.\n\nEdit to add: I put a sketch of the store layout in the comments to show where Jeff's hideout was inside the store and where his tunnel to the Circuit City was.\n\n\n\nI have not seen the movie yet (only the trailers), nor was I involved in the production in any way. I tried so hard to be involved, but every avenue I pursued was met with either silence or a kind but definitive, \"there is nothing we need from you.\" I guess all that is to say that I have no inside information about the movie whatsoever, nor can I speak definitely on why any decisions about the story being told in the movie were made. I only know what I experienced while the events unfolded, and what my coworkers told me of their experiences.\n\nI began working at the Independence Blvd. Toys 'R' Us in 1999 when I was still in high school, until around the middle of 2005. I worked weekends, holidays, and summers to fit my school schedule, and as the store could afford to take me on, since they didn't have a large employment budget and only managers and supervisors were eligible for full-time status. I began as a cashier, and my responsibilities were eventually expanded to floor sales (which was really a catch-all for a very wide range of activities), until I was ultimately promoted to work in the electronics department ('R'Zone) and entrusted with a security access to the high dollar items there. Also, once it was discovered that Jeffrey was living behind the wall, I actually got to go into his lair before it got cleaned out.\n\nLooking at the trailers, the movie does seem to be getting a lot right. Based on interviews, I know they spoke extensively with Jeffrey Manchester and many people involved in the events. They even cast some of those people in small roles (quite glaringly is the distinct absence in the marketing materials of any TRU employees being involved in any way). As far as what they got wrong... Here are a few to get things started:\n\n- Perhaps the most glaring and surprising change to the story is that Jeff's girlfriend, Leigh, was absolutely not a TRU employee. We would have all known and been extremely creeped out (even more than we already were!) if this had been the case.\n\n- They seem to be omitting a major part of the story, which is that there was an abandoned Circuit City attached to the TRU which Jeffrey connected via a hole in the storeroom wall and created a second lair. I also crawled through the hole after the fact and saw this second space before it got cleared out.\n       - Related to the abandoned Circuit City, Jeffrey did not set up his baby monitor surveillance system out in plain sight. He drilled holes in the adjoining wall from the Circuit City and placed the cameras there, which hid them far more effectively.\n\n- There was no store manager at the time that acted in any way how Peter Dinklage's character acts. The managers and comanagers were all kind, if overworked and stressed, and would *never* have sneered at a request to participate in a toy drive (the answer may have been out of their hands, but they would not have been condescending about it). I suspect they are making the Dinklage character out to be the \"bad guy\" of the movie. Which is also weird because, you know, the employee were the victims.\n- Small thing, but our name tags were much smaller, had different designs, and were oval shaped. Also, our uniforms were red button-down shirts and black pants.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now. Ask away!",

Tatum is no longer the cocky teenager he was in the \u201cStep Up\u201d movies all those years ago, as the star\u2019s affected swagger has eased into a natural confidence, while Dunst brings just the right amount of wariness to a woman who\u2019s devoted to her kids and devout in her faith.

        "self_text": "I\u2019m sure some of are  aware of Jeffrey Manchester otherwise known as \u201cThe Roofman.\u201d He was a spree-robber and former United States Army Reserve officer who robbed up to 40-60 McDonald\u2019s restaurants throughout the country from 1998- 2000, entering them by drilling through the roof and dropping in.\n\n He was eventually arrested and imprisoned. About four years into his sentence, he broke out and relocated to another state, changing his identity. He  ended up living in a Toys \"R\" Us store, staying in backrooms and other areas inside, surviving on kids' snacks and baby food, and exercising during the night when the store was closed by riding a bike throughout the store aisles. During the holiday rush of December 2004, Manchester moved his living quarters to an abandoned Circuit City next-door to avoid detection, creating a room under a stairwell where he painted the walls, put up posters, and passed the time watching movies during the day.\n\nBetween June and January of the following year, he devised an elaborate plan to takeover and rob the Toys \"R\" Us in his biggest robbery to-date, setting up an elaborate surveillance system throughout the store using baby monitors, and even subtly changing employee schedules to accommodate his plans. As time passed, he came under more and more suspicion as employees noticed many missing items as a result of Manchester's residence, making his plans tighter.\n\nEdit:\n\nBy that time, he became a member of the community to bide time until the robbery, even dating a local woman, and joining a Church. He spent a large a lot of his time with her and her kids, bringing them toys he had taken from the store he lived at, and covering his seeming unemployment and homelessness with secretive whispers about a highly-confidential job for the government, saying his quarters were in a restricted office building.\n\nBefore carrying out the big Toys \"R\" Us robbery, He burned down a dentist's office where he had gotten work on his teeth done during his time there, to eliminate his dental records and reportedly robbed a pawn shop to acquire a gun in preparation for the robbery. On the morning of December 26, robbed the Toys \"R\" Us, taking an unknown amount of cash before being forced to flee after two employees were able to slip out of the store to get law enforcement, leading to police discovery of His secret lodgings in Circuit City and discovering the only fingerprint in the room, which was ironically on a DVD of \"Catch Me If You Can\".\n\nOddly enough, he didn\u2019t flee town after committing the Robby. After his girlfriend found out his true identity, who she believed to be a man named \"John Zorn\", the police convinced her to call Him to her home where he was recaptured upon arrival. His expected release date is December 4, 2036.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m kind of rambling here, To anyone familiar with this case, I\u2019m very interested to know what he Toys \u201cR\u201d Us mancave/hideout looked like. Unfortunately there aren\u2019t any photos anywhere on the internet, but apparently there are articles that talk about it. Can anyone here provide links to the articles that detail its appearance?

Paramount's ***Roofman*** also debuted with solid numbers, although it also shows the difficulty of selling original comedies. And Jennifer Lopez had one of her worst debuts as lead star with ***Kiss of the Spider Woman***.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $64.0 million this weekend. That's slightly down from last year, when ***Terrifier 3*** opened with an impressive debut, and ***Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux*** collapsed a steep 81.4%.\n\nDebuting at #1, Disney's ***Tron: Ares*** flopped with just $33.2 million in 4,000 theaters. That's below ***Tron: Legacy***'s debut ($44.0 million), which is crazy considering this had so much inflation on its side. There's no point comparing it to the 1982 in terms of opening weekend.\n\nGiven that this cost $180 million ($10 million more than ***Legacy***), it's absolutely disappointing that ***Ares*** opened below it. In fact, the performance is eerily similar to the box office failure of ***Blade Runner 2049***: a sci-fi sequel released in October with a $180 million budget, but it could only open to $32.7 million. \n\nThere was a time for a ***Tron*** film, and it seems like Disney just waited too long to capitalize on it, and also took multiple wrong decisions. First, 15 years is way too long to release a sequel. Yes, ***Legacy*** released 28 years later, but Disney effectively sold the film as an original piece that would intrigue newcomers and also attract old fans. For many, this was probably the first ***Tron***, so ***Ares*** lacked the novelty aspect.\n\nBut there's a bigger problem, and it's that ***Tron*** is just not a very successful franchise in terms of box office. The original ***Tron*** made over $50 million worldwide back in 1982, but Disney was reportedly disappointed with its performance, which is why they didn't pursue a sequel. It wasn't until 2005, when Sean Bailey advocated for the film after it garnered a cult following. The result was ***Tron: Legacy*** in 2010, but even though it made $409 million worldwide, the high costs once again disappointed Disney. So you can see that the franchise has performed the studio's expectations twice.\n\nWhile ***Legacy*** also grew on to earn a cult following, Disney didn't really chase the audience. In March 2015, they finally greenlit a ***Legacy*** sequel, with Garrett Hedlund and Olivia Wilde reprising their roles, and Joseph Kosinski returning as director. But just two months later, they scrapped the film after the failure of ***Tomorrowland***. And so everyone involved moved to different projects.\n\nUntil in 2017, Jared Leto began circling a new ***Tron*** film. It didn't fully gain traction until 2023, when Joachim R\u00f8nning signed as director, with Leto serving as producer. But the film's lack of connection to ***Legacy*** ended up hurting the film; while it could help a newcomer join the film without watching the prior films, it also lost fans of the previous film. Hell, even Jeff Bridges' presence was limited in the marketing and in the final product. \n\nThe film was also hurt by its Leto connection; he's not really well-regarded by audiences, and sexual misconduct accusations from a few months ago also signaled problem. Double-edged sword though; if Leto didn't advocate and produce, the film wouldn't exist. The marketing was also a mixed bag; they highlighted that the Grid was coming to the real world, when the appeal of ***Tron*** is staying in the Grid. And the film's mediocre reception (56% on RT) was the nail in the coffin. It lost ***Legacy*** fans, and it didn't really intrigue non-fans.\n\nAccording to Disney, 68% of the audience was male. Gen Z and Millennials were its biggest audience; 52% was 18-34. No interest in the people who watched the original back in 1982 though; only 25% of the audience was 45 and over. They gave it a middling \"B+\" on CinemaScore, the exact same score as the previous films. It has no holiday legs to hold well like ***Legacy***, and it's unlikely it adds new fans in the next few weeks when it loses IMAX and PLF. For now, a $85 million domestic total for ***Ares*** is likely. Very, very poor numbers. It means it will have less attendance than the original ***Tron*** ($110 million adjusted).\n\nIn second place, Paramount's ***Roofman*** debuted with $8.1 million in 3,362 theaters. This is director Derek Cianfrance's biggest debut, overtaking ***The Place Beyond the Pines*** ($4.9 million), although in fairness, he never had a single film playing in more than 1,600 theaters. The debut was above Channing Tatum's previous film ***Blink Twice*** ($7.3 million), but below ***Fly Me to the Moon*** ($9.4 million).\n\nThe budget was kept low at $19 million, so this is a solid debut. It simply shows how difficult it can be to sell comedies, especially when it also involves crime. Even with its crazy real-life story, which was plastered all over the marketing, the audience was very limited in giving it a chance. Even though Paramount tried to build buzz by sending it to Toronto, it was still a challenge even with great reviews on its side (85% on RT).\n\nAccording to Paramount, 53% of the audience was male, and its biggest audience was women over 25 at 38%, thanks to Tatum's presence. They gave it a \"B+\" on CinemaScore, which is solid for a film like this. These kinds of films are noted for holding well, and with a weak October ahead, perhaps it could have a decent run. For now, ***Roofman*** should hit close to $30 million domestically.\n\nEven though it lost IMAX and PLF screens, ***One Battle After Another*** had a better drop than last week. It eased just 38%, adding $6.8 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $54.6 million, and it should continue holding well for the rest of the month.\n\nAfter its steep drop last week, ***Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie*** recovered by dropping 35%, for a $3.5 million weekend. The film has earned $26.5 million domestically, and it should finish with a little above $35 million domestically.\n\nIn fifth place, ***The Conjuring: Last Rites*** dropped just 25% this weekend, for a $3.1 million weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $172.6 million.\n\nSony released ***Soul on Fire*** in 1,720 theaters, earning an okay $2.8 million this weekend. Even with an \"A\" on CinemaScore, it'd be a surprise if it reached $10 million.\n\n***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 The Movie: Infinity Castle*** dropped 36%, for a $2.2 million weekend. With $128.6 million, it has officially passed ***Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon*** ($128.5 million) to become the biggest non-English film domestically.\n\nA24's ***The Smashing Machine*** had a very poor debut last week, and its second weekend reflects that audiences are abandoning the ship as soon as possible. The film collapsed all the way to eighth place with a horrible 69%, which is a pathetic $1.7 million weekend. That translates to a very weak $541 per-theater average. A drop like this is not surprising, considering the film's divisive word of mouth. Through 10 days, the film has earned an abysmal $9.8 million. With such a poor per-theater average, it's gonna lose tons of theaters this week. The film is now guaranteed to miss $15 million domestically, and could even miss $12 million depending on its drop next week. It's gonna be Dwayne Johnson's worst ever wide release. It's crazy that despite its high $50 million budget, the film is not gonna be in A24's top 25 highest grossing films.\n\n***The Strangers: Chapter 2*** dropped 42%, adding $1.6 million this weekend. Its domestic total stands at $13.5 million, and it doesn't have much left in the tank.\n\nRounding out the top 10 was IFC's ***Good Boy***. It dropped a pretty good 40%, for a $1.4 million weekend. Through 10 days, the film has made $4.9 million so far.\n\n***The Long Walk*** continues holding well. It eased just 39%, grossing $1 million. That took its domestic total to $33.9 million.\n\nIn 12th place, Roadside Attractions' ***Kiss of the Spider Woman*** flopped with an abysmal $891,046 in 1,331 theaters. That's Jennifer Lopez's worst ever wide debut, and it translates to a meager $669 per-theater average. Unsurprisingly, the film just couldn't connect with audiences. With little award buzz, the film is going to disappear quickly from theaters. Needless to say, it won't come anywhere close to the 1985 original's domestic gross ($17 million).\n\nAmazon MGM released Luca Guadagnino's ***After the Hunt*** in 6 theaters. It earned $158,679, which is a solid $26,447 per-theater average. It's set to expand into around 1,200 theaters this weekend.\n\nA24 also released ***If I Had Legs I'd Kick You*** in 4 theaters. It earned $89,164, averaging $22,291 in each theater. It will continue adding theaters in the next few weeks.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Tron: Ares*** also got off to a very weak start outside America. It opened with just $26.7 million overseas, for a very poor $59.9 million worldwide debut. It had very soft to mediocre debuts in Mexico ($2.9M), the UK ($2.4M), France ($1.9M), Australia ($1.5M) and Germany ($1.4M). Given its massive $180 million budget, the film's path to profitability is going to be insanely hard. Nowhere close to ***Legacy***'s $409 million worldwide finish. We'd like to say that this is the nail in the coffin for the franchise, but let's face it, we'll probably see another one in 15-20 years.\n\n***One Battle After Another*** added $15 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $138.1 million. The best markets are the UK ($11.2M), France ($8.5M), Germany ($6.4M), Italy ($4.4M) and Australia ($4M). It reaches its final market, China, this week.\n\n***Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie*** added $7 million, for a $46.3 million worldwide total. Its best markets are Australia ($2.9M), Mexico ($2M), Italy ($1.7M), France ($1.1M) and Poland ($1.1M).\n\n***The Conjuring: Last Rites*** has crossed $300 million overseas, and its worldwide total is now $473 million. Best markets are Mexico ($30.5M), the UK ($24.1M), France ($22.3M), Brazil ($17.5M) and Germany ($16.4M).\n\nWith $648 million worldwide, ***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 The Movie: Infinity Castle*** is now officially the fifth biggest film of the year.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*A Big Bold Beautiful Journey* | Sep/19 | Sony | $3,252,578 | $6,671,082 | $20,171,082 | $45M\n\n- There's nothing beautiful about this. Sony's ***A Big Bold Beautiful Journey*** has closed after just 3 weeks with an abysmal $6 million domestically and $20 million worldwide. A big failure, even considering its mid $45 million budget. A huge, huge stain in the careers of Margot Robbie, Colin Farrell, and director Kogonada. Even with the talent, poor reviews and word of mouth sank the film. Ouch.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nUniversal is releasing Blumhouse's ***Black Phone 2***. Despite the original's ending, Ethan Hawke is back, going full Freddy Krueger mode. Given that it surprised everyone by grossing $161 million worldwide, a sequel felt inevitable. But there's still questions over whether the audience is on board with a sequel, and Blumhouse's brand has taken a massive dive in the past year with so many failures. Will this save them?\n\nLionsgate is releasing Aziz Ansari's directorial debut ***Good Fortune***, starring Ansari, Seth Rogen and Keanu Reeves. It seeks to bring comedy into theaters, with a fantasy angle (a guardian angel causes a body swap and shenanigans ensue). It had a solid response in Toronto (83% on RT), but it remains to be seen if audiences will show up.\n\nIn limited release, Sony Pictures Classics is releasing Richard Linklater's ***Blue Moon***, starring Ethan Hawke, Margaret Qualley, Bobby Cannavale, and Andrew Scott. With high acclaim (97% on RT, 78 on Metacritic), look for this to have one of the year's strongest per-theater averages.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

        "self_text": "I will continue to update this post as reviews come in.\n\n[**Rotten Tomatoes:**](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/roofman) Certified Fresh\n\n**Critics Consensus:** A disarmingly sweet tonal gearshift for director Derek Cianfrance,\u00a0*Roofman*\u00a0is shaggy as a narrative but expertly tailored to Channing Tatum's strengths as an eminently likable leading man.\n\n|Critics|Score|**Number of Reviews**|Average Rating (Unofficial)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**All Critics**|85%|115|7.10/10|\n|**Top Critics**|70%|23|6.40/10|\n\n[**Metacritic:**](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/roofman/) 64 (29 Reviews)\n\n**Sample Reviews:**\n\nKatie Walsh, Tribune News Service - Roofman is predominantly a one-man showcase for the full range of Tatum's talents, but the entire ensemble is crucial for any good caper. Dunst's prowess pushes his own performance, while Peter Dinklage offers levity as the stern store manager Mitch. **3/4**\n\nRobert Abele, Los Angeles Times - Roofman, with its breezy decency, knows how to finesse just the right amount of compassion for larceny.\n\nMichael Ordo\u00f1a, San Francisco Chronicle - \u201cRoofman\u201d hooks viewers with its compelling depiction of a person too smart for his own good. It\u2019s funny and moving, however close to or far from the real events it may be. **3/4**\n\nNatalia Winkelman, New York Times - Here is a protagonist who clearly straddles the line between right and wrong; the trouble is that in \u201cRoofman,\u201d that line wobbles, leaving the movie somewhere between a fun-loving caper and a finger-wagging morality tale.\n\nRafer Guzman, Newsday - Lived-in performances and a sensitive screenplay make for a thoroughly engaging comedy-drama. **3/4**\n\nKyle Smith, Wall Street Journal - A master class in how not to direct a comedy. With its slow pacing, shaky handheld cameras, dishwater cinematography and unnervingly extreme closeups, it feels more like an intense indie drama than a whimsical tale of a robber with a peculiar M.O.\n\nLindsey Bahr, Associated Press -The film succeeds in doing what it aimed for: Presenting a humane portrait of a guy who will be serving most of his life behind bars, in crowd-pleasing packaging. **2.5/4**\n\nDavid Fear, Rolling Stone - It\u2019s a movie that stumbles every so often, overplays its hand numerous time, and relies on an oddball true-story premise and 1000-watt star power to pave over some of the rougher spots. It would also give you its coat if you needed it without asking.\n\nRadheyan Simonpillai, Globe and Mail - The struggle for Cianfrance is getting the tone right with a story about a superficially chivalrous thief who nurtures a sense of kinship with the people he ultimately victimizes.\n\nOdie Henderson, Boston Globe - Tatum\u2019s sparkling charm can only take him so far; the script, by Cianfrance and Kirt Gunn, spends way too much time on a romantic subplot filled with sitcom scenarios and uninteresting characters. **2/4**\n\nBillie Melissa, Newsweek - Cianfrance's Roofman finds the perfect balance between suspense, heart, and pure entertainment, making it one of the most enjoyable watches of 2025.\n\nKristen Lopez, The Film Maven - Roofman succeeds on Channing Tatum's charm which covers up for a pretty thin script. Cianfrance tells another story about personal choice that, unlike his past work, does feel lighter and more hopeful. **C**\n\nSophie Butcher, Empire Magazine - Derek Cianfrance delivers a hugely empathetic, very entertaining depiction of an extraordinary life, featuring one of Channing Tatum\u2019s best performances. Expect laughs, tears, and noughties nostalgia. **4/5**\n\nThelma Adams, AARP Movies for Grownups - An incredibly tender love story develops at the heart of this American true-crime caper. **5/5**\n\nKristy Puchko, Mashable - Roofman is a frustrating watch, refusing to fit into the genre expectations. But that might be precisely the point.\n\nMark Hanson, Slant Magazine - The real Jeffrey Manchester may in fact have been polite, but Derek Cianfrance\u2019s film doesn\u2019t convince you that it needed to be as well. **2/4**\n\nTim Grierson, Screen International - The film tries so hard to paint Jeffrey as an endearingly flawed curiosity that he lacks the rough edges or mystery that would make such a person compelling.\n\nDavid Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter - This is the kind of disarming crowd-pleaser for which cringe-inducing clich\u00e9s like \u201cit will sneak up and steal your heart\u201d were invented. What\u2019s refreshing about Roofman is that it\u2019s never too aggressive about it. It\u2019s sentimental but sincere.\n\nMarya E. Gates, [RogerEbert.com](http://RogerEbert.com) \\- \u2018Roofman\u2019 is a slick but incurious film that is so preoccupied with showing the what of Manchester\u2019s story that it doesn\u2019t bother to examine the why. **2/4**\n\nBenjamin Lee, Guardian - It works mostly because of Tatum and Dunst, a rare on-screen pairing of single parents in their 40s, both trying to navigate a stressful situation, hard enough even without the criminality. There\u2019s real chemistry there. **3/5**\n\nSteve Pond, TheWrap - The tonal juggling act isn\u2019t always seamless, but in a way, the contradictions are what give \u201cRoofman\u201d its life. It\u2019s a sad movie, really, but it\u2019s also a lot of fun. And if that doesn\u2019t make sense, maybe it\u2019s the whole point.\n\nKatie Rife, IndieWire - Unfortunately, however, \u201cRoofman\u201d also capitulates to the feel-good demands of Hollywood storytelling, leaving the pricklier aspects of Manchester\u2019s story on the table. And the film is forgettable as a result. **C+**\n\nPeter Debruge, Variety - In the end, it\u2019s the through-the-roof chemistry between the two leads that makes the film worthy of repeat viewing.\n\n**SYNOPSIS:**\n\nBased on an unbelievable true story, Roofman follows Jeffrey Manchester (Channing Tatum), a former Army Ranger and struggling father who turns to robbing McDonald\u2019s restaurants by cutting holes in their roofs, earning him the nickname: Roofman. After escaping prison, he secretly lives inside a Toys \u201cR\u201d Us\u00a0for six months, surviving undetected while planning his next move. But when he falls for Leigh (Kirsten Dunst), a divorced mom drawn to his undeniable charm, his double life begins to unravel, setting off a compelling and suspenseful game of cat and mouse as his past closes in.\n\n**CAST:**\n\n* Channing Tatum as Jeffrey Manchester\n* Kirsten Dunst as Leigh Wainscott\n* Ben Mendelsohn as Ron Smith\n* LaKeith Stanfield as Steve\n* Juno Temple as Michelle\n* Melonie Diaz as Molly Price\n* Uzo Aduba as Eileen\n* Lily Collins as as Lindsay Wainscott\n* Jimmy O.

Channing Tatum has played this type of character before, but his turn as Jeffrey Manchester I think is his Apex. The way that he acts with kids, the charm that he has with just about everyone and the goodness that exists in his character all feel genuine. \n\nBut at the same time you know that what he's doing is wrong, but he just can't escape the bad decisions that he continues to make, which are presented to be understandabIe. It leaves you wondering when the other shor is going to drop.\n\nThought that Tatum and Dunst had really good chemistry, and there are a few scenes that were so heartbreaking. \n\nAlso, as someone who was a teenager in that era, having this take place in 2004 was awesome with the popular stores and restaurants at the time and also seeing those prices back then lol. But I think the movie is a lot of fun and offers a lot to people, I hope it's able to make it's money because I think it's a well crafted true story that is memorable. ",

The credits begin and it goes...\n\nChanning Tatum (obviously), Kirsten Dunst (of course)...\n\nNow, I'm assuming third-billed will either be LaKeith Stanfield who is obviously the most famous person in this movie besides the Dink (who I know has to be the \"And\" and is indeed the \"And\") and a pretty important role... or LaKeith has secured the \"With\" credit and it's going to be Juno Temple getting third because of her Ted Lasso credentials and sharing most of her scenes with LaKeith.\n\nThe third-billed actor is Ben Mendelsohn! He's in the movie for maybe five minutes as the pastor at the church Channing and Kirsten go to and has basically no scenes with serious dramatic *or* comedic heft to them. I laughed when he appeared initially in the movie because it's Ben Mendelsohn with long hair but that's the entirety of his role.\n\nBut you know what, okay, because LaKeith probably secured the \"with\" and Mendelsohn is a blockbuster villain actor and presumably decent buddies with Cianfrance after The Place Beyond the Pines - wait what? LaKeith got fourth billing after Mendelsohn who has *no* plot importance in the movie and no real role in the movie at all???\n\nLaKeith should've either got third billing or the \"with\" for Roofman and the fact that he didn't and lost it to a cameo-sized role for Ben Mendelsohn means he should fire his agent. I'm sorry if this is too dramatic but this was insane billing.",

        "self_text": "I just got out of seeing The Running Man today and it made me think about how the four movies mentioned above have all come out this year with the same three major story pieces;\n\n1. A everyday man with interesting qualities\n\n2. Capitalism/greed/the police state wrongs him in some way\n\n3. He goes to extreme lengths to find a resolution that corrects this wrong\n\nI know these pieces are pretty general and are widely applicable to many movies, but I think all four of these movies have almost identical parts. While they are all told in extremely different ways, their endings, plot points, and characters are almost completely interchangeable with one another depending on how authentic or critical the movie is trying to be. It\u2019s also interesting that the four lead male roles are played by leading men that ruled their decades (Tatum and DiCaprio in the 2010\u2019s, Butler and Powell in the 2020\u2019s.)\n\nThe overarching theme however, is what effects late stage capitalism and a police state have on a person and what lengths that person will go to, to avenge their misgivings. Almost all characters lose something (usually family) or are threatened with losing them. There is such a fervent undertone in all of these movies about how untrustworthy, scheming, and vile capitalist/police state actors are. I find it to be uniquely tied to our current political moment in the 2020\u2019s, but all movies go about speaking on that message so differently. Caught Stealing and Roofman are far more subtle, OBAA and The Running Man are far more direct. They\u2019re all in different genre\u2019s as well, so the way in which they make their social critiques are vastly different, but they all point to a mistrust of power, and an urgent call to fight back, in an extreme way, against it (whether it be  living in a Toy\u2019s R\u2019 Us and finding a new family despite the police state branding you unfit for society, or blowing a hole through a network TV head\u2019s. . .head.) \n\nBut all of their endings kind of don\u2019t fit their movies. I wish Roofman had Caught Stealing\u2019s ending (I know it was based on a real story but still), I wish Caught Stealing had OBAA\u2019s ending, OBAA had The Running Man\u2019s ending, and The Running Man had Roofman\u2019s ending. I think that order would allow each of these movies to have the best and most effective impact on audiences if the message is to mistrust power. \n\nI\u2019ll admit, Caught Stealing is the least revenant movie here, but I feel like its plot is so close to being in this category, and could easily be just as socially critical as the running man if a few plot points were changed or lines of dialogue added in. If Austin Butler\u2019s character lost his mom to a curable illness instead of getting into a car crash that prevents him from being goated at baseball, I think caught stealing could be on par with One Battle After Another in terms of how uniquely American and modern its story is (yes I know it takes place in the 90\u2019s but its story still feels so connected to the modern day. And its slice of life late 90\u2019s in New York vibe is extremely appealing.) \n\nHas anyone else noticed this, and what are your thoughts? Do you disagree?",

Don't do like \"It'll make less than this or that\" or \"double this movie or half this movie\". We want a real prediction.**\n\n#**2. Given that a lot of parent comments do not even bother to give predictions, we are establishing a new rule. The parent comment must provide a prediction with specific numbers. The rest of the replies to the comment do not have to make a prediction, but the parent comment absolutely has to. Any parent comment without a prediction will be eliminated.**\n\nWelcome to the newest edition of r/BoxOffice Long Range Forecast.\n\nWe're making long range predictions for films, 4 weeks out from their premieres. You will predict the opening weekend, domestic total and worldwide gross of these films. These predictions will be open for 48 hours and the results will be polled to form a consensus and posted the next week.\n\nSo let's meet the three films for the week and analyze each pro and con.\n\n#**Tron: Ares**\n\nThe film is directed by Joachim R\u00f8nning (*Kon Tiki*, *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales*, *Maleficent: Mistress of Evil*, *Young Woman and the Sea*) from a screenplay by Jesse Wigutow, based on a story by David Digilio and Wigutow. It is the third installment in the *Tron* series, and stars Jared Leto (who also produces), Greta Lee, Evan Peters, Jodie Turner-Smith, Hasan Minhaj, Arturo Castro, Cameron Monaghan, Gillian Anderson, and Jeff Bridges. It follows a highly sophisticated program, Ares, who is sent from the digital world into the real world on a dangerous mission, marking humankind's first encounter with A.I. beings.\n\n#**Roofman**\n\nThe film is directed by Derek Cianfrance (*Blue Valentine*, *The Place Beyond the Pines* and *The Light Between Oceans*), from a screenplay by Cianfrance and Kirt Gunn. The film stars Channing Tatum, Kirsten Dunst, Ben Mendelsohn, LaKeith Stanfield, Juno Temple, Melonie Diaz, Uzo Aduba, Lily Collias, Jimmy O. Yang, and Peter Dinklage. The film is a biopic of the fugitive Jeffrey Manchester, a former United States Army Reserve officer, known colloquially as Roofman due to his propensity to steal from branches of McDonald's after entering their premises via the roof. Most notably, he evaded capture by police by hiding in the wall of a Toys \"R\" Us store.\n\n#**After the Hunt**\n\nThe film is directed by Luca Guadagnino (*A Bigger Splash*, *Call Me By Your Name*, *Suspiria*, *Challengers*, *Queer*, etc.) and written by Nora Garrett. Starring Julia Roberts, Ayo Edebiri, Andrew Garfield, Michael Stuhlbarg and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, it follows Alma, a college professor caught in between a sexual abuse accusation involving one of her students and a colleague.\n\nNow that you've met this week's new releases, let's look at some pros and cons.\n\n#**PROS**\n\n- The *Tron* franchise has grown a massive cult following in subsequent years. *Tron: Legacy* still made $400 million worldwide, indicating that audiences were very interested in the world of these films. And its popularity has grown through home media and streaming. The trailers emphasize that it's the same old *Tron*, just that it made its way to the real world. So far, all trailers have been visually stunning. It also stars a cast ensemble of known actors, or actors who are on their way up. While Daft Punk is not back for the score, Nine Inch Nails is a pretty well respected and highly regarded successor. But most importantly: its biggest advantage is that it's the sole high-budget blockbuster of October, now that *Mortal Kombat II* was moved to May 2026.\n\n- Channing Tatum is one of the most popular male stars. *Dog* got to $85 million solely on his own, and his team-up film with Sandra Bullock in *The Lost City* made its way to $190 million. Not to mention a lot of pre-pandemic hits. So *Roofman* is highly dependent on how much audience cares for his presence. The good news: audiences have responded very well to Tatum when he stars on comedies, and *Roofman* is pretty much that. Derek Cianfrance may not be a well known name for audiences, but his presence usually guarantees good quality. And judging by the TIFF's reviews, it's looking promising; it's sitting at a 88% on RT.\n\n- Luca Gudagnino is a well known name in cinephile circles, and his second-to-last film, *Challengers*, was his biggest film with around $96 million. For a drama, the star is important and while Andrew Garfield and Ayo Edebiri have their fans, the real huge star is Julia Roberts; *Ticket to Paradise* made $168 million worldwide (quite great for a rom-com nowadays), and *Leave the World Behind* became the fifth biggest English title on Netflix's history. This should definitely intrigue thriller fans.\n\n#**CONS**\n\n- So *Tron* has grown in popularity... but how much? Mainly asking, because at the end of the day, the previous two *Tron* films were considered box office disappointments. Even though *Legacy* has grown in audience, *Ares* goes of its way to not reference it much; neither director Joseph Kosinski or stars Garrett Hedlund, Olivia Wilde and Cillian Murphy (whose cameo was intended for a villain role in a sequel) are back. Even Jeff Bridges' presence is very limited in the trailers, in contrast to his big role in *Legacy*. 15 years is also quite long to release a follow-up. And yes, the actors are well known... but the one weak spot is its own very own star, Jared Leto. Once respected, his credibility has fallen off in recent years thanks to a lot of critical and financial duds. Not to mention, [sexual misconduct accusations.](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/07/jared-leto-accused-sexual-impropriety)\n\n- While Channing Tatum is a very well known name, his luck in theaters hasn't exactly paid off recently. *Magic Mike's Last Dance* was the lowest in the franchise by a wide margin, *Fly Me to the Moon* was a huge box office disaster, and *Blink Twice* didn't even crack $50 million worldwide. Cianfrance is a respected filmmaker, but his highest grossing film (*Pines*) made only $47 million, which isn't a lot of money. It's also gonna have some comedy competition the following week when *Good Fortune* opens.\n\n- Guadagnino is very popular in cinephile circles, but when it comes to the box office, the results don't really reflect that. *Challengers* made $96 million, but it still lost money due to its budget. The rest of his films haven't fared well; his follow-up to *Challengers*, *Queer*, flopped with just $7 million. In fact, outside *Challengers* and *Call Me By Your Name*, his films usually end with less than $20 million worldwide. Roberts is definitely a huge name, and there should be interest in seeing her in another psychological thriller. But a film like this (where the theme is #MeToo) needs great reviews to stand a chance, and it seems like it was a rare Guadagnino misfire; it's currently sitting at a very weak 51% on RT. That not only could dilute interest, but it could be a sign that word of mouth won't be on its favor.\n\nAnd here's the past results.\n\nMovie | Release Date | Distributor | Domestic Debut | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total\n:-------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|\n*Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 The Movie: Infinity Castle* | September 12 | Crunchyroll | $45,364,285 | $90,121,428 | $595,039,285\n*Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale* | September 12 | Focus Features | $15,863,636 | $40,950,000 | $89,655,000\n*The Long Walk* | September 12 | Lionsgate | $10,750,000 | $27,720,000 | $52,636,363\n*Spinal Tap II: The End Continues* | September 12 | Bleecker Street | $3,355,555 | $7,372,222 | $9,444,444\n*Him* | September 19 | Universal | $24,550,000 | $73,664,285 | $109,410,714\n*A Big Bold Beautiful Journey* | September 19 | Sony | $11,160,714 | $33,171,428 | $68,471,428\n*One Battle After Another* | September 26 | Warner Bros. | $30,078,947 | $99,500,000 | $218,015,789\n*Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie* | September 26 | Universal | $19,227,272 | $57,154,545 | $152,354,545\n*The Strangers \u2013 Chapter 1* | September 26 | Lionsgate | $9,558,333 | $25,925,000 | $57,583,333\n*The Smashing Machine* | October 3 | A24 | $20,085,294 | $59,523,529 | $113,617,647\n*Anemone* | October 3 | Focus Features | $4,725,000 | $13,416,666 | $33,316,666\n*Shelby Oaks* | October 24 | Neon | $4,240,000 | $9,791,666 | $14,945,454\n\n**NOTE:** We predicted *Shelby Oaks* last week, because it was set for October 3.

        "self_text": "BASED ON ACTUAL EVENTS. AND TERRIBLE DECISIONS. \n\nDirector Derek Cianfrance is a filmmaker who dives into stories about well-meaning people making poor choices. His characters often walk the line of criminality\u2014smart, clever, and skilled at deception\u2014while also knowing how important it is to avoid violence. If you had one of these characters as a neighbor, you'd probably think highly of them. Take the character in \"Roofman,\" for example, who believes that breaking and entering, with a sprinkle of kidnapping, is the best way to provide for his family and loved ones. His relationships are in shambles, and to truly fix them, he needs to grow up and try a different approach. He sees normal behavior as beneath him, fearing that if he gets stuck in it, he\u2019ll just fade away. He has the opportunity to break free and find happiness, but greed, emotions, or plain old foolishness always seem to trip him up. Cianfrance has delivered some very good films like \"Blue Valentine\" and \"The Place Beyond the Pines,\" and now with \"Roofman\" living up to that standard.\n\nWith a lighter vibe than much of his previous work, it\u2019s fun to watch our lovable, albeit clueless hero try to mend his relationship and reconnect with his kids, especially his young daughter. If his family won\u2019t take him back, he\u2019s determined to prove himself. He has a knack for observation and creativity that helps him devise clever ways to steal or escape. Throughout his journey, we see him recognize and sharpen his unique skills. The fun part for us is watching how he navigates various situations. We\u2019re right there with him, brought to life by Channing Tatum, who gives life and heart to the role. The tough part is knowing that eventually, things are bound to go wrong, and we\u2019re left anticipating that moment. That\u2019s when the sadness creeps in, revealing a character who wears a mask of happiness and confidence but consistently drags those around him down.\n\nBe sure to stay for the credits. I had no idea about any of this when I began watching the movie.",

After escaping prison, he secretly lives inside a Toys \u201cR\u201d Us for six months, surviving undetected while planning his next move. But when he falls for Leigh (Kirsten Dunst), a divorced mom drawn to his undeniable charm, his double life begins to unravel, setting off a compelling and suspenseful game of cat and mouse as his past closes in.",
