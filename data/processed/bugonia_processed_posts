    "title": "2026 Oscar Predictions - November Edition",
    "selftext": "There has been quite a few interesting developments since my last prediction in September. Mainly being the hit to Wicked's stock and Frankenstein overperforming. I look forward to watching the remainder of contenders in December and January to get some more insight\n\n**Best Picture:**\n\n1. One Battle After Another\n2. Hamnet\n3. Sentimental Value\n4. Sinners\n5. Marty Supreme\n6. Frankenstein\n7. It Was Just an Accident\n8. Jay Kelly\n9. Wicked: For Good\n10. Avatar: Fire and Ash\n\nIt really looks like OBAA is going to have a dominant sweep. Hamnet has had a recent decline in reviews and I don't think SV or Sinners have much of a chance. The response to Jay Kelly seems to be improving so I feel ok about it for now. I'm open to dropping Wicked but I haven't seen the film yet. Part 1 was a huge hit with the industry and this one will make a ton of money with audiences not rejecting it\n\n**Best Director:** \n\n1. Paul Thomas Anderson - One Battle After Another\n2. Chloe Zhao - Hamnet\n3. Jafar Panahi - It Was Just an Accident\n4. Joachim Trier - Sentimental Value\n5. Josh Safdie - Marty Supreme\n\nPTA should sweep but this is a difficult category to fill out. Coogler, GdT, Park Chan-wook are strong alternatives. I feel good about Panahi being the \"longtime respected international director\" slot but I'm not sure about 4 and 5\n\n**Best Actor:**\n\n1. Timothee Chalamet - Marty Supreme\n2. Leonardo DiCaprio - One Battle After Another\n3. Ethan Hawke - Blue Moon\n4. Wagner Moura - The Secret Agent\n5. George Clooney - Jay Kelly\n\nI'm starting to feel really good about Leo winning but I'll keep Timmy for now since i haven't seen Marty Supreme and have had him winning for a long time. I think Leo could easily win BAFTA and has a strong shot at SAG and GG. Ethan Hawke was tremendous in Blue Moon but a solo win like that seems to be a thing of the past. Plemons is an interesting option but I feel like the industry won't be that high on Bugonia. MBJ will have to be considered if he gets into GG, CC, SAG and BAFTA longlist\n\n**Best Actress:** \n\n1. Jessie Buckley - Hamnet\n2. Renate Reinsve - Sentimental Value\n3. Amanda Seyfried - The Testament of Ann Lee\n4. Rose Byrne - If I Had Legs I'd Kick You\n5. Chase Infiniti - One Battle After Another\n\nLooks like Buckley has this sewn up. I find the last 2 spots of this category to be very difficult. I don't think Stone will get in because I don't anticipate Bugonia being a big hit. I didn't find her performance to be especially impressive by her standards and I think there could be some fatigue with voters seeing her almost exclusively in Yorgos movies. After seeing IIHLIKY I can see Byrne as a textbook example of film twitter hopediction. A24 will be pushing her well and maybe she can win GG and some big critic prizes though. Infiniti does not give a lead acting nomination performance but fuck it, OBAA is going to be huge and it's often exciting to nominate a debut role.\n\n**Best Supporting Actor:**\n\n1. Stellan Skarsgard - Sentimental Value\n2. Sean Penn - One Battle After Another\n3. Paul Mescal - Hamnet\n4. Benicio del Toro - One Battle After Another\n5. Adam Sandler - Jay Kelly\n\nPenn could start off strong with CC and some big critic prizes but I think Skarsgard will prevail in the end. Even with Frankenstein's strength I think Elordi could just be a critics pick and Sandler will get in as a veteran who has been proving himself recently\n\n**Best Supporting Actress:**\n\n1. Teyana Taylor - One Battle After Another\n2. Ariana Grande - Wicked: For Good\n3. Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas - Sentimental Value\n4. Gwyneth Paltrow - Marty Supreme\n5. Amy Madigan - Weapons\n\nI really don't see Taylor's performance as being an Oscar winner but I think that's the way it's heading. I didn't have Madigan in for a while but I really see a route of her winning CC and getting into 1-2 more precursors\n\n**Best Original Screenplay:**\n\n1. Sentimental Value\n2. Sinners\n3. Marty Supreme \n4. It Was Just an Accident\n5. Jay Kelly\n\nThis is potentially a very divided and close race between the first 4. I was thinking about IWJAA winning but after the seeing the film I feel doubtful. I don't know if that film will play very well with the Academy at large \n\n**Best Adapted Screenplay:**\n\n1. One Battle After Another\n2. Hamnet\n3. Frankenstein\n4. Bugonia\n5. Wake Up Dead Man\n\n**Best International Film:**\n\n1. Sentimental Value\n2. It Was Just an Accident\n3. The Secret Agent\n4. No Other Choice\n5. Left-Handed Girl\n\n**Best Animated Film:**\n\n1. Zootopia 2\n2. KPop Demon Hunters\n3. Little Amelie\n4. Arco\n5. Elio\n\n**Best Documentary Feature:**\n\n1. 2000 Meters to Andriivka\n2. Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk\n3. Mr. Nobody Against Putin\n4. Apocalypse in the Tropics\n5. The Alabama Solution\n\n**Best Casting:**\n\n1. Sinners\n2. One Battle After Another\n3. Hamnet\n4. Jay Kelly\n5. Sentimental Value\n\n**Best Cinematography:**\n\n1. One Battle After Another\n2. Sinners\n3. Marty Supreme\n4. Train Dreams\n5. The Testament of Ann Lee\n\n**Best Editing:**\n\n1. One Battle After Another\n2. Hamnet\n3. Marty Supreme\n4. Sinners\n5. F1\n\n**Best Production Design:**\n\n1. Frankenstein\n2. Wicked: For Good\n3. Hamnet\n4. Marty Supreme\n5. Avatar: Fire and Ash\n\n**Best Costume Design:**\n\n1. Wicked: For Good\n2. Frankenstein\n3. Hamnet\n4. Sinners\n5. Kiss of the Spider Woman\n\n**Best Makeup and Hairstyling:**\n\n1. Frankenstein\n2. Wicked: For Good\n3. The Smashing Machine\n4. Sinners\n5. Weapons\n\n**Best Visual Effects:**\n\n1. Avatar: Fire and Ash\n2. Superman\n3. F1\n4. Tron: Ares\n5. Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning\n\n**Best Sound:**\n\n1. F1\n2. Sinners\n3. One Battle After Another\n4. Avatar: Fire and Ash\n5. Wicked: For Good\n\n**Best Score:**\n\n1. Sinners\n2. One Battle After Another\n3. Hamnet\n4. Jay Kelly\n5. The Testament of Ann Lee\n\n**Best Original Song:**\n\n1. Sinners - I Lied to You\n2. KPop Demon Hunters - Golden\n3. Wicked: For Good - Girl in the Bubble\n4. Diane Warren: Relentless - Dear Me\n5. Train Dreams - Train Dreams\n\n",

    "selftext": "contenders i’ve seen: ballad of a small player, bugonia, captain america: brave new world, colorful stage! the movie: a miku who can’t sing, die my love, elio, frankenstein, hamnet, a house of dynamite, it was just an accident, kpop demon hunters, lilo &amp; stitch, little amélie, a minecraft movie, no other choice, one battle after another, the perfect neighbour, rental family, resurrection, roofman, sinners, sorry baby, superman, thunderbolts*, together, the twits, wake up dead man, weapons, wicked: for good, wolf man\n\ni’ll also note that i’m seeing blue moon in an hour and a half so maybe that’ll change some of my predictions\n\nhere’s my explanations:\n\npicture:\n\ncan’t deny that those wicked: for good reactions were concerning, but i honestly don’t think they mean that much. it was always aiming for the populist blockbuster slot, so as long as it does well at the box-office and audiences love it it’s fine. both of those things are happening, so i’m leaving it in. plus i can’t justify removing it from any other category or it missing picture with a package this strong. i’ve put ann lee in, since searchlight is now campaigning for it. it might be weird and divisive, but so was emilia pérez. hate to remove bugonia but it just doesn’t seem quite strong enough to get in unfortunately. i’m starting to worry about jay kelly crashing an otherwise great lineup, but i’ll wait for the reactions when it’s out on netflix before i do anything drastic. bottom 5 are basically random, i doubt we get anything outside of this top 15\n\ndirector:\n\ni’m not budging on pcw under any circumstances, and anderson, zhao, and panahi all feel like locks. the 5th slot is very difficult, there’s so many movies where missing just feels wrong. i ended up going with del toro since he has netflix behind him, but i’m prepared to be wrong. wasn’t sure what to do with the 10th slot, since the 10th film in my picture lineup is clearly not a director player, but train dreams probably feels the most likely of the films i have near picture\n\nactor:\n\ni’m so desperate for lee byung-hun to win, i know it’s a hopediction but he really just deserves it that much. i had marty supreme going drama at the globes, but now that it’s confirmed comedy there’s no reason to doubt moura here. i’m not gonna say ethan hawke isn’t happening, but i don’t really see any reason to predict him at the moment when the category is this strong. i’m abour to see blue moon, so maybe that’ll change my mind. is it just me or is oscar isaac being kinda underestimated?\n\nactress:\n\nbuckley is clearly unbeatable\n\nbuckley is clearly unbeatable. seyfried and erivo are pushing their films into best picture, so i’m not losing confidence them unless i stop believing in the films completely. torn between stone and infiniti for the 5th slot, but went with stone since i can’t see plemons getting in without her. maybe tessa thompson surprises here, i’m not taking the cca shortlists too seriously but hedda did show up a lot so maybe we’re underestimating it. would love it if lawrence had a shot, but i don’t see it\n\nsupporting actor:\n\ninsanely strong lineup this year, feels like any of the top 4 could end up taking it. with that being said, i struggle to see why they’d go for penn. he has 2 oscars already, doesn’t care about campaigning much, and is a fairly controversial guy. it feels more like skarsgård vs. mescal, with elordi having a chance of overperforming. i feel like one of the sinners actors is getting in here, and caton has the stronger performance and seems to be getting the bigger push. del toro is great, but i just can’t see him getting enough #1 votes\n\nsupporting actress:\n\ni know glenn close is an unusual pick here, and i’m prepared to be wrong, but this race is really giving 2022 to me. our main options are an extremely strong performance in a slightly underwhelming sequel to a beloved blockbuster, and a great performance in the picture frontrunner that doesn’t leave as strong of an impression as the film’s performances in the other categories. and in that race, they ended up choosing the performance from an overdue veteran that they’ve never gotten the chance to award before. obviously this is a completely different situation in many ways, but i just suspect it will end similarly, since i struggle to see any of the frontrunners taking it. i’ve put in a’zion partially because i’m not sure about the other contenders and partially because i don’t have marty supreme getting enough nominations. maybe infiniti sneaks in here a la lakeith stanfield?\n\ncasting:\n\ntough race between sinners and obaa, but since i have caton getting in and infiniti missing, sinners makes more sense. going with the long-shot of iwjaa, which has an incredibly strong ensemble of first-time actors and would be a very inspired nomination. we still don’t know how this category works but hopefully they’re cool enough to go for stuff like superman\n\noriginal screenplay:\n\nthe 5th slot is so hard. can someone who’s seen ann lee tell me what the screenplay is like? musicals often don’t get screenplay nominations unless they’re really strong, is the writing good enough? i’m going with jay kelly for now because it feels weird for it to blank completely, but would love it if sorry baby could surprise here. i have iwjaa winning just because it’s their only real opportunity to award panahi (international feature doesn’t go to the director), and i imagine they’d want to give him something\n\nadapted screenplay:\n\ni’m so desperate to hopedict no other choice winning here but even i know that’s too far. the top 6 all feel super strong to me, their packages just wouldn’t make sense without screenplay. i guess frankenstein is probably the weakest link, but it still doesn’t feel right for it to miss. how are you people making room for train dreams?\n\ncinematography:\n\ni’m still just as confused here as i was a month ago. brutally strong lineup. sinners missing is a wild prediction but it just feels like the kind of movie to unexpectedly miss a couple of techs, if that makes sense. resurrection would be such a good nom, hoping it can get into the shortlist so it has a shot\n\nediting:\n\nthis category never does anything interesting, i’ve got nothing to say here. they better not snub noc\n\nsound:\n\nwhy do people think f1 can win here? it’s not the kind of thing they award at all, they always go for picture players. and this year has so many picture players that fit into this category! i know they normally have at least one below-the-line player that sneaks in, but in my mind that’s avatar, which i do not buy in picture at all. in my mind, if f1 gets in, but it would be more of a dead reckoning/the creator-style nom\n\nvisual effects:\n\nkind of an unusual lineup, but these techs with shortlists usually give us one or two surprises. frankenstein is a strong contender, but it doesn’t have amazing vfx and the competition is strong, and it would feel weird to leave f1 out of sound and keep it here. how to train your dragon is being underestimated, i know we all hate live-action remakes but it’s very cgi-heavy and a big financial success with great reviews from audiences and positive reviews from critics, plus everyone i know who works in the film industry has been glazing it like crazy. it just doesn’t feel like something that would miss here. i find it weird how everyone’s ignoring mickey 17 here, the reviews might not have been parasite-level but they weren’t bad at all and the vfx were great. can’t wait until the electric state to get shortlisted and everyone says they forgot it came out this year\n\nmakeup:\n\ni’ve been holding onto wolf man for a while since i was very impressed with the makeup, but i just can’t see them nominating 3 horror movies. this branch historically has a lot of genre bias, i know two got in last year but that was the first time any horror got in since 2010. and it’s so hard to fill the 5th slot with something that’s not horror! i went with superman, but im not even confident that will make the shortlist tbh. i’ve heard the makeup in blue moon is bad so i didn’t choose it, but maybe i was misinformed and i’ll change my mind after seeing it. intrigued by kokuho since it got onto the cca shortlist despite being a foreign film with no buzz. not sure what the makeup is like, but maybe that suggests it’s strong?\n\ncostume design:\n\ni dont really think anything is locked, but it’s hard to see a different line-up happening imo. maybe hedda gets in if its stronger than we think, but i’m not gonna overreact to the critics’ choice shortlists. i feel like i’m the only person who recently switched to wicked, but after seeing it i was even more impressed with the costumes than the first one.\n\nproduction design:\n\nalso seems like a pretty clear lineup, maybe ann lee gets in but i haven’t seen anything to suggest the production design is that strong\n\ninternational feature:\n\nthis branch never goes with the obvious 5, but it’s hard to see any of these missing. hind rajab is definitely the most vulnerable, but even though there’s a lot of strong options here, nothing really feels strong enough to justify replacing it. there’s so many movies i’m looking out for, to the point that i did a top 15 instead of a top 10, but i just can’t make space for them\n\ndocumentary feature:\n\nthe perfect neighbour is exactly the kind of thing they snub here, i’m not buying it at all. was holding out hope for andré is an idiot but it wasn’t even on the list of eligible films so i guess that’s out. i haven’t put that much thought into most of my choices here, nobody really knows what they’re doing with this category anyway\n\nanimated feature:\n\nwhy would they not submit ne zha 2???? this 5th slot is impossible to fill, elio so clearly has everything working against it but there’s just no other options. i’m at the point where i’m considering just going crazy and actually putting the miku movie in (in a just world it would sweep). \n\nscore:\n\ni’ve kinda run out of steam at this point writing this. these are pretty normal score predictions, there’s nothing crazy here that warrants an explanation. idk i’ve got nothing to say\n\nsong:\n\ncouldn’t fit in the post because i’m limited to 20 images, i’ll put in the comments when this gets approved. i need something from the miku movie to get shortlisted here so bad. “salt then sour then sweet” feels like the kind of out-of-nowhere pick this branch likes",

    "selftext": "I wasn’t able to find the exact still where Teddy’s mother starts floating out of the bathtub, but the second I saw the reference I got a chill, because it works so well as a reference!\n\nMy interpretation of the original shot is that it communicates how protagonist’s mother has become an «elevated», super-human, almost metaphysical presence in the protagonist’s life, to the degree that all his future relationships become attempts at re-creating that original dynamic between himself and his mother. In his imaginations of her, he creates a being that can literally defy gravity.\n\nIn Bugonia, I think the reference works first on a surface level. Teddy is a clearly a character with mommy-issues, and it’s referencing another film about a character with similar issues. But on a deeper level, Teddy’s dynamic with his mother fundamentally similarly shapes how he relates to the people and world around him, and in a way that’s central to the film. I think it’s clear that Teddy’s fight against the system in service of the planet, is really a fight to save his mother, and in his mind there’s no distinction between to two (or at least the line become jumbled to in his mind). \n\nTo me, the moment Teddy’s mum begins to levitate in the bathtub is also the moment she takes on a greater metaphysical presence in Teddy’s life, and that’s why I think it’s a damn good reference.\n",

    "title": "Theory for Michelle",
    "selftext": "Just finished the movie and I had a very distinct impression about Michelle the whole movie, but I have some points to back up my theory so here we go.\n\nFrom the beginning we're introduced to Michelle as this very robotic, a bit awkward, kind of CEO who is running her ship too tight. She's attempting to put bandaids on gushing wounds and her damage control isn't working. She's also a perfectionist and wrapped in intense privilege with her position.  \n\nMy theory is that Michelle never believed in humanity and because of this their end became inevitable through her own actions. She was not making a bipartisan assessment and experimentation of the species, but rather pushing for their destruction all along. \n\nFrom Teddy's point of view we can see one of the worst case scenarios of what Michelle's company has done to humanity. We can also see this when, at the end of the movie, her brethren on the ship tell her the other experiments have pretty much all failed. \n\nLooking a little deeper, I remember her comment about bees at the dinner table. How she admires them because they don't complain, they aren't pious or self righteous, and they work for the collective cause. This reflects back to her leadership at the company and how she has failed her human worker bees, but believes it is their own fault. Michelle has shown, from the viewers perspective, that she lacks fundamental empathy for humans. \n\nThe reason I believe my last statement is because when she is speaking to her assistant about letting people leave at 5:30 pm for the day, she goes back and forth in a very artificial way to make it clear that despite the setbacks on worker's rights, she expects them to still get the unreasonable workload done without complaint. It is very reflective of how human CEO's are and how Michelle has herself devolved into a more ruthless and selfish version of her personality (stated towards the end of the movie). \n\nA small tidbit I also want to add is that I think Michelle enjoyed her position above humans and wanted to maintain it while making sure the experiments still failed. This is evident by her strict routines in the beginning of the movie. If she is an alien with access to alien technology, why would she be so hyper focused on her aesthetics in such a primitive way if not for the enjoyment of playing her character? Like an actor in a play. \n\nWhen she is explaining history to Teddy she smiles a bit when she explains that humans used to worship her people, and then shows anger when explaining how humans devolved and destroyed one another. Never once does she seem to accept her species responsibility in leading to these events nor does she seem remorseful about humans plighted existence from the beginning. No, she only shows sympathy for her Emperor and his poor decision making. \n\nIn a way her character very much reminds me of a reflection of the idea of Lucifer, except in this story Lucifer wins. \n\nThat's all I've got 😊👍🏻\n\nEdit: I just remembered too when Michelle is lying to Teddy about why the bees are dying it seems to infer that her company is purposefully killing the bees, which would lead to the direct destruction of the human race. Her rhetoric to him is the same rhetoric used by real companies who are absolutely lying and doing the destruction they claim they aren't doing. \n\n\n",

This movie is produced as a sort of inside joke referencing Emma Stone's desire to cut shave her head, as she prefers it, and finally getting her to admit doing so makes her appear like an alien to some of her close friends in real life. This movie is a gag and parody that is made with a high quality production and cast all to joke about Emma cutting her hair. Personally I think it is a beautiful movie as I can see the fun the actors had creating this film and the intricate humor layered in the script and acting.\n\n  \nEDIT: Don is actually never filmed with anyone else in the room.

The black sidebars made most my screen feel dead, but at the same time the film probably would’ve looked even stranger stretched out to a standard 1.78:1 release.\n\nWhat I enjoyed was the look and feel of the movie. The bright colors, odd designs, abstract sets, and alien environments all felt like classic Yorgos imagination. Some of the frame compositions were genuinely beautiful. The score mostly stays in the background, occasionally stepping forward to sharpen the tension, though I honestly found it weaker than composer's work in Poor Things.\n\nEmma Stone delivers, and Jesse Plemons is doing career best stuff right now. This might even be his strongest performance yet. And yes, the hype about Emma shaving her head for the role didn’t go much to waste as I thought, she delivered.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the movie was the mental-chess dynamic between Teddy and Michelle. Teddy keeps pushing, adjusting his approach, cornering her psychologically in small, while Michelle is trying to stay three steps ahead, even though she knows Teddy is circling closer and closer to the truth. Their back-and-forth feels like a game without rules, but with real stakes. It’s subtle but interesting to watch. I also liked the \"Save the Green Planet!\" theme, this feels like Yorgos' own take on it.\n\nThe final reveal was exactly the kind of thing I expected from Yorgos, something bizarre, mythic, and strangely funny.\n\nWhat I’m stuck on is the rating. I floated between 3.5 and 4 the whole time. I liked it a lot, even admired parts of it, but I didn’t love it the way I thought I'd do.\n\n**Rating:** 4/5 (but honestly feels like a 3.75 to me)",

Whether it’s pesticides or something else, Bugonia wants us to see ourselves in Teddy. Fiercely appealing to hierarchy in assigning blame for whatever societal or personal ill we are experiencing. Be it a tech CEO, an Alien or a God, we never seek an answer which could be an ‘amalgamation’ of misunderstood lower level factors but that we demand a singular vector through which to filter our wrath and frustration.\n\nWe always seek to understand those above us in the hierarchy but it is NEVER in reverse. In the same way that the Aliens tried to ‘guide’ and preserve life to some extent in a “global” sense, they cannot understand the actual nuances of what our needs are nor do they care (Teddy’s mother). We can no more understand a tech CEO or a God than a Bee colony can understand Teddy's motives as a bee keeper.\n\nI feel like the biggest statement this film makes is that blame seeking, EVEN IF you are completely right about your intuitions never results in a good solution. It’ll always end up as antifreeze in our veins. We as a society will always seek to blame and find restitution in higher powers / entities which cannot understand our grievances nor do they care about our individual suffering.",

I searched conspiracy for some fun posts about it, but didnt really find anything to chew on. \nTheres a few blink and youll miss it conspiracies plastered throughout, but mostly towards the end.\n\nParticularly that the earth was flat and that our version of space does not exist. Much like Eddie Bravo and other really in too far conspiracy theorists have said for years now. I think this is a really fun discussion, and would like to engage with actual conspiracy theorists here that believe in flat earth and no space theory. How closely did this movie get to these theories? What was the same and different? \n\nIve also been an ancient astronaut theorist since i was like 16. And this also played into that. \n\nAnyway, super good movie, and id love to discuss any thoughts on its conspiratorial subject matter. \n\nSide note: Really well done in the woke/not woke/normal movie regard. I feel like it pleases both sides without pissing them off. This is what movies are supposed to be like when they have political messaging in them. Dont alienate half your audience (pun intended).",

    "title": "98th Oscars - Above the Line Category Predictions (Post-Wicked, Pre Globes and CCA)",
    "selftext": "**BEST PICTURE**\n\nBefore we delve into CCA and Globe noms, I still feel comfortable with OBAA as our frontrunner with Hamnet and Sinners as my spoilers, 4-7 seem like solid bets. Let’s talk Wicked since it’s not the lock I thought pre-embargo, with reviews being less enthusiastic overall, there’s a valid argument about it missing the 10. I’ll keep it in purely off of box office, crafts and Erivo &amp; Grande for but I would have it in the 8-12 range. No Other Choice stays in and rounding out my 10, I have The Testament of Ann Lee off of Seyfried and techs.\n\n\n\n**DIRECTING**\n\nI still have PTA winning even if One Battle doesn’t take Picture, I feel confident about Zhao and Panahi, with the last 2 slots being a shuffle of Coogler, Safdie and Trier. With how Sinners is positioned, I feel comfortable about Coogler placing but not locked by any means. Other contenders that are dark horses for noms I think include Guillermo del Toro, Mona Fastvold and Kleber Mendonça Filho.\n\n\n\n**LEAD ACTRESS**\n\nAs of late, this category has boiled down to Buckley winning with spots 2-5 up for grabs. Reinsve seems solid for the nom, same applies for Seyfried. Let’s talk about Cynthia Erivo, before the embargo, I moved her up to number 2 viewing her as a possible dark horse to Buckley, now I think she’s fighting for a spot. I’ll keep her in for now since I still have Wicked in my Picture lineup but if it falls out or she loses the Globe to either Seyfried or Byrne, she could miss to Chase Infiniti or even Emma Stone. Unless Song Sung Blue is like Nyad, Hudson’s ain’t happening.\n\n\n\n**LEAD ACTOR**\n\nI don’t have as much to say on this category. With Marty Supreme continuing to warm up in reactions, I still have Chalamet taking it with DiCaprio as my alternative based on his film’s strength. Hawke’s looking solid for the nomination, I won’t rule him out as a potential threat but only if Blue Moon overperforms, feel comfortable about Moura and Jordan. Other contenders I won’t rule out would be Clooney, Byung-hun, Plemons or Edgerton.\n\n\n\n**SUPPORTING ACTRESS**\n\nThis category gives me an aneurysm. I think Grande could win based on what she’s doing (plus a little category fraud doesn’t hurt) but only if Wicked stays in Picture. Moving Teyana Taylor to the top is not something I feel confident in but I have her as One Battle’s acting win, with the comparisons to Mahershala Ali in Moonlight compelling me for now. If I had my way, Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas would be our front runner with how open this field is, anyone could take it, hell I won’t rule out Amy Madigan or even Glenn Close at this rate.\n\n\n\n**SUPPORTING ACTOR**\n\nOf the 4 acting categories, I have the least to say. Mescal, Penn and Skarsgård are your locks dooking it out for the win, with the remaining spots being a shuffle of del Toro, Elordi and Sandler. I’ll lean Benicio based on him coattailing Penn and being the character audiences respond to the most, and Elordi with the amount of mentions he’s gotten but if Jay Kelly returned into my Picture 10, Sandler could take his spot.\n\n\n\n**ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY**\n\nFor now, I have Sinners winning as Coogler’s consolation prize although Sentimental Value and It Was Just an Accident are in the mix. Marty Supreme is looking pretty good for the nomination, and rounding out my 5 is Jay Kelly as it’s lone nom but I’ll acknowledge it could very easily be a Best Picture staple. Please nominate Sorry, Baby and I won’t shut up for months but other possibilities aside from that would probably be Testament of Ann Lee, The Secret Agent, Blue Moon and maybe Weapons or Is This Thing On? but we’ll see.\n\n\n\n**ADAPTED SCREENPLAY**\n\nOne Battle and Hamnet are locked with the other three spots looking up for grabs. Since I have No Other Choice in Picture, this checks out here, I’ll keep on Bugonia for now but it's nowhere near a lock here and my one hot take is Wake Up Dead Man misses out for Train Dreams as its lone nomination. Bentley and Kwedar are fresh off nominations for Sing Sing last year and if Netflix campaigns it right, that could play a factor here. Frankenstein is an outside shot but the only ATL shot it looks good for would be Supporting Actor, I don’t see Wicked happening and if you would like to entertain NEON revives Life of Chuck here, let me know below.\n\n",

With the subtitles on all she and her kind discuss are how they couldn't reach her since she didn't have hair anymore and that a decision must be made in regards to the humans fate. \n\nSince I didn't watch it with subtitles tonight I forgot what they originally said and I think it plays so much better. They talk in their language and she is upset and ultimately takes that pointy chopstick/wand thing and pops the earths bubble and all humans die.\n\nThe dialogue she and her kind have are not 100% vital to understanding what happens next and how the film ends. I think it plays much, much better this way.",

    "selftext": "I am currently sick and therefore have too much time on my hands, so here is my predictions for these two groups.\n\n**AFI Top 10**\n\n- Avatar: Fire and Ash\n- Bugonia\n- Frankenstein\n- Hamnet\n- Marty Supreme\n- One Battle After Another\n- Sentimental Value\n- Sinners\n- Train Dreams\n- Weapons\n\nCommentary: Weapons is giving a A Quiet Plave where it performs really here and gets like a PGA nomination. They nominated Emilia Perez because of Zoe Saldana and Selena Gomez, so I assume Sentimental Value gets in here because of Elle Fanning. \n\nAlternate pick is probably Jay Kelly. My prediction is that Wicked *will* miss here and that will wake the last people up to the reality that this is vulnerable in Best Picture.\n\n...\n\n**National Board of Review**\n\n- WINNER: One Battle After Another\n\nTop 10\n- Frankenstein\n- Hamnet\n- A House of Dynamite\n- Is This Thing On?\n- Jay Kelly\n- Marty Supreme\n- No Other Choice\n- Sinners\n- Train Dreams\n- Wicked: For Good\n\nCommentary: Who knows with this group. Last year they had their worst Oscar overlap ever with only four films crossing over to Best Picture from their 11 mentions. As an Oscar precursor this group means truly nothing. I am just having fun here and throwing darts.\n\nOBAA fits very well with their past winners: a big budget action film, Warner Bros and a well-known director they've actually rewarded before. Sinners would be my strong alternative pick.\n\nRegarding noms, A House of Dynamite just feels like something they would do given their tastes. Sometimes they throw in random indies here, hence my Is This Thing On? mention. They do NOT like International films, the only ones that got nominated from recent years are The Boy and the Heron and RRR. So against my better judgement I'm going with No Other Choice.",

Due to it's current buzz based on reported screenings it has the potential to be a major contender (hence, my placement of it in Picture, Screenplay, and as the Alternate Pick in Lead Actor) but I still think it's a bit early to have it winning any major prizes. Come December however, this could very easily change.\n\nCurrently, I just don't see it winning anything major due to the sheer strength of not just One Battle After Another, but Sinners.\n\nI've viewed both films on two occasions throughout the year, and strongly believe that aside from Hamnet, they will be this year's primary contenders: with Warner Bros pushing OBAA in ATL categories to synergise with PTA's narrative and its status as the BP frontrunner, and pushing Sinners in BTL categories to capitalise on its technical aspects, in addition to Original Screenplay, to increase Coogler's chances of an Oscar win.\n\nAdditionally, I have the trio of OBAA, Hamnet and Sinners dominating the Acting Categories. Having recently rewatched Sinners, I believe it makes more sense for Warner Bros to give more of a balanced push to both film's performances, rather than going all in for the unlikely chance of OBAA recieving a record breaking 6 nominations ([which I speculated upon the other day](https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/1p45l6n/could_one_battle_after_another_do_the_thing/)). Therefore, I have Mosaku and Lindo in the slots I previously had predicted for Hall and Del Toro, as much as I love the latter two.\n\nIt's simply more balanced and logical. As many of you pointed out, while Hall and Del Toro's performances are strong, they are relatively brief and a little one-note. After rewatching Sinners yesterday, I feel that Mosaku and Lindo's performances have better nomination chances: not only do they have more screentime, but I feel their film provides stronger showcases of their acting ability than OBAA does for Hall and Del Toro.\n\nNow onto the Acting Winners and Song before I wrap things up. Like I said, I'm not putting all my faith in Marty until I've seen it, or the film's wide reviews are released. Therefore, I have Leonardo winning his second Best Actor Oscar, with Chalamet in second place, although Chalamet may gain the push he needs if Marty's buzz is strong enough come December. (Emphasis on may, as I strongly believe OBAA's momentum could bring Leo over the line regardless, it's just that strong). Similarly, due to Wicked's middling reception (for an awards contendor) combined with the sequel curse, I have Teyana Taylor as the Supporting Actress frontrunner. Her screentime is short for a win contendor, but it's looking like a Mahershala Ali in Moonlight situation to me.\n\nIn all, I believe OBAA is just too strong to go home empty handed in the Acting Categories, so Leo or Teyana winning (if not both of them) is just a no-brainer. I don't Chase Infiniti winning BA against Jessie Buckley, and Stellan Skarsgard's overdue narrative is honestly too good to pass up: as a matter of fact, I believe his biggest threat is Paul Mescal rather than Sean Penn (due to Hamnet's strength and Penn's two previous wins), so I may move Penn to 3rd and Mescal to 2nd in the future).\n\nFinally, song is the most interesting category to me. Whilst I have Golden at number one, as a Let it Go type winner, it could certianly be overtaken by I Lied to You based on how much the Academy loves Sinners. Honestly? I wouldn't be mad either way. I love both songs, and to be honest, the best case scenario in this category for me personally (while it's unlikely) is a tie between the two. I don't see it happening, but you never know I guess.\n\nI really hope my yapping hasn't bored any of you to death, or broken any rules this place might have about overlong posts. Do tell me what you think, and as this is my first predictions, I'm very open to criticism. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.",

The CGI was awful at times. The whole point of these movies were made to have a few moments where you go \"omg! Dorothy, the yellow road, omg tin boy, omg red shoe\". \nA character dies by getting a house cycloned on top of them.\nWhen I think about these movies I want to cause 10s of thousands of dollars of damage to my own property. \nThese films brought out a rage inside of me I didn't know was possible. That is how passionate I am about these movies. \nI will be watching Bugonia again to rid myself of this Wicked(:for Good(2025)) ball of hatred.",

As far as we know, One Battle After Another, Hamnet and Sinners are currently the top three frontrunners (perhaps with Marty Supreme too), but for the time being I've been hoping to share my personal predictions on what films I think will get in. I may be feeling pretty confident that One Battle After Another and Sinners will have the most nominations, but it depends on what the awards season will lead (still rooting for Hamnet, Marty Supreme and Sentimental Value along with the other films in contention).\n\nWithout further ado, here are my 98th Oscar nomination predictions for November 2025:\n\n# Best Picture\n\n* *Avatar: Fire and Ash*\n* *Frankenstein*\n* *Hamnet*\n* *It Was Just An Accident*\n* *Marty Supreme*\n* ***One Battle After Another***\n* *Sentimental Value*\n* *Sinners*\n* *The Testament of Ann Lee*\n* *Wicked: For Good*\n\n*Next in line: Bugonia, Jay Kelly, No Other Choice, The Secret Agent, Train Dreams*\n\n*Alt: Blue Moon, F1, A House of Dynamite, Is This Thing On?, Weapons*\n\n*Wildcards: The Chronology of Water, KPop Demon Hunters, Sound of Falling, Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere, Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery*\n\n# Best Director\n\n* *Chloe Zhao, Hamnet*\n* *Jafar Panahi, It Was Just An Accident*\n* ***Paul Thomas Anderson, One Battle After Another***\n* *Joachim Trier, Sentimental Value*\n* *Ryan Coogler, Sinners*\n\n*Next in line: Guillermo del Toro, Frankenstein; Josh Safdie, Marty Supreme; Park Chan-wook, No Other Choice; Kleber Mendonça Filho, The Secret Agent; Jon M.

I remember there being a character with long hair (maybe white or wearing a white dress/robe) and a sword. I have some word salad ive associated with the trailer like ninja, demons or vampires, retribution or revenge. Its not the Demon Slayer movie or Scarlet. Any help is appreciated",

Bugonia\n\nOkay, I know that literally no one on the face of the earth is predicting Yorgos Lanthimos to get into director, let alone for the movie to get into picture. But, I put a lot of thought into this, and I realized, the Academy tends to only nominate 1 director of a foreign film per year, *sometimes* 2. So it's safer not to predict Panahi because it's another foreign film. The reason I snubbed Panahi over Trier is because Sentimental Value has more strength as a film, because it is in contention for 4 acting noms, and a win for screenplay. As for the Wagner Moura snub, I think that the film *The Secret Agent* is not really in contention for anything except Actor and *maybe* Picture and/or screenplay. Whereas Bugonia is likely to get into Picture, Actress, Screenplay, and *probably* Cinematography (hopefully). So it makes more sense that Jesse Plemons could take Moura's slot, which is arguably the most vulnerable. And the reason I predicted a lot of technical wins plus Screenplay for Hamnet over OBAA is because I think that if the Academy goes with OBAA for Picture, Director, and Supporting Actor, they'll want to give Hamnet at least a few things more than just Actress. Anyways, everyone reading this probably deeply disagrees with me, so if you could explain why instead of just simply saying no, that'd be great!",
