        "selftext": "Spoilers for A House of Dynamite ahead. \n\nI gave \"A House of Dynamite\" a chance as Netflix was boasting it being their #1 movie for the day, and who doesn't love a good movie about the ever-present threat of nuclear armageddon? But after spending two hours watching this blue-balling collection of scenes packaged as a \"movie\", I am shocked this cut ever made it onto Netflix. \n\nSo first, I want to say the first half of this is EXCELLENT. Not only does it do a great job of building tension, but I loved the premise of the situation rapidly becoming more and more dire. The idea that even with all our technology and people and protocols, we can still be so helpless is not only terrifying but genuinely thought-provoking as well. And if they just stayed and built with that, this probably would have been an easy slam dunk. \n\nBut then, the second half arrives. We backtrack to roughly all the same events we just saw from the perspective of others involved (between the President and General(?)). Now this is not in itself a bad choice. Different perspectives can be a great opportunity to get new information that makes our understanding of the situation richer, or just to understand more about how those involved are feeling. The problem is, though, we don't get that. \n\nInstead, we get a RECAP of what we just saw, with almost the EXACT same dialogue we heard before. And it is ROUGH and boring to bear through. For example, they make us go through the whole motions of waiting to see if the interception worked, even though we saw not even 20 minutes ago it didn't! There's no suspense here, why are we seeing this again?! \n\nAnd for the little bit of extra scene and dialogue added, we're not given anything that makes it worth seeing the events from these different perspectives. This was so bad I had to pause and make sure I didn't somehow rewind to the beginning. It genuinely felt like they took alternative cuts from the first half and slapped them on the second half to make the runtime.\n\nAnd then, the ending. Ohhhh my goood. \n\nNow I'm going to get some people here saying this is supposed to be an ambiguous and open-ended ending, meant to leave us thinking and feeling hollow. The only problem with this argument is that it's bullshit, because it's just not an ending. \n\nIf you were reading a book, and I copied and pasted a random line from the middle of my book, and made that the only sentence in the final chapter, would you consider that  appropriate? Of course not! You would probably think it's an error or I didn't finish the book! So then, why is it magically allowed here? \n\nA House of Dynamite, objectively, does not have an ending. They took a random scene of the soldier collapsing from the first half of the movie, pasted it to the end, added a fade to black, and called it a day. If there was ANYTHING new here, even just a slight extension of what we saw before in this scene, then maybe I could get it a pass. But this is not the case. It's just... nothing. \n\nA House of Dynamite, in its current form, is flat-out incomplete. It's a draft of a movie. It is 40 minutes of content that acts like it ran out of a budget halfway through, so it just repeats itself with deleted scenes and cuts when it runs out of those. \n\nI think what pisses me off so much about this is the potential with its concepts and what it tries to talk about. I love the aura of hopelessness and doom that permeates, and the conflicting ideas from everyone on what to do. There is clearly a great film to be had here, but it just... isn't here man. \n\nAnd now, here is the end to my post - giving you something this movie didn't. Thank you for reading.  ",

        "selftext": "This movie absolutely does not enforce \"THE MESSAGE\" and in many ways undermines it.\n\nIts a great, tense flick, though it is inspired by book that didn't quite understand deterrence, it is a very authentic and spooky presentation of a nuclear crisis.\n\nI have a few examples that are slightly spoilery, about how this movie avoids \"THE MESSGAGE\".\n\nFirstly, while there are plenty of female and or black characters, they are not girlbossess, lucy sues or wonderkids.\n\nHowever, its how the movie handles two black characters that really cements it for me.\n\n&gt;!1. There is a young FEMA bureaucrat black chick who is, of everyone in the film, by far the least competent and energetic in her duties. She gets selected to be saved in a bunker, much to the upset of her colleagues that think she is incompetent and inexperienced. This plays on your assumptions and reiterates the reality that if nuclear war breaks out, the people who are saved in the preservation of p\\[population and operations plans will NOT necessarily be the ones that deserve it. The character does nothing except react slowly and save herself, that is literally it. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!(There are also other competent and likable people of color in the film)!&lt;\n\n&gt;!2. The president is clearly meant to be Obama, played by Idris Elba. And, despite being calm and cool at the start, he's revealed to be just as unsuitable and indecisive, resorting to calling his freaking wife to decide whether to engage in a thermonuclear exchange. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!If the president had been modeled on Trump, the takeaway from the film for normies would be \"don't elect Trump to avoid this crisis\", which was the error Civil War made by going with a Trumpian president. Its message was \"don't start a civil war over politics, its not worth it\", but normies thought it was saying \"Trump will start a civil war\". This movie avoids that problem- it plays with your expectations and the audiences concepts (right or wrong), about ideal leaders. The movie is basically saying \"even if your Sugar Daddy Obama is president, hes still just a normal dude at the end of the day and not qualified to make these calls- because nobody really is.\". The only way to win this game is to never play. !&lt;\n\nIts a breath of fresh air for a modern hollywood director, especially a woman, to be so unfathomably based. There are a few other Chekovs that don't go off i wont spoil here.   The movie is awesome in a whole bunch of ways, but i just though the users of this sub would appreciate these tidbits.",

What I try to focus on is maybe being more disciplined than many professional movie critics, in anchoring my opinions to objective standards. I'll do my best at keeping my more subjective opinions out of this write-up.\\]\n\nSPOILER ALERT - I'll mention plot developments that will ruin the movie for you if you haven't seen it yet. Watch it. It's still an enjoyable movie even if you concur with it having the flaws I lament. And if you disagree, it's an even more enjoyable one.\n\nPremise: I'm a lover of the nuclear crisis movie genre. I've seen them all.\n\nI think it's impossible watch this movie without measuring it against the many (and many great ones) that have been made on the topic: The Day After, Fail Safe (both the 1964 original, and its 2000 remake), War Games, By Dawn's Early Light, Crimson Tide. Bigelow has chosen a genre in which a lot of good work has already been done. The comparison is hard.\n\nIn the first thirty minutes of the movie we learn that an SLBM has been launched toward the US, and later we learn it's targeting Chicago. Our response forces send up two interceptor missiles which fail, and the device is set to hit Chicago. The exposition is extremely procedural: we literally sit in the rooms where decisions are taken, with the frustration of having to make decisions potentially affecting hundreds of million of lives, but on the basis of limited and ambiguous information. I'm no expert, but the procedural aspects seem well researched and re-created. The cast is stellar. The acting is top-notch. The dialogues are reasonably realistic. There doesn't seem to be any over-the-top overdramatization that many other movies insist on.\n\nThe thing at which Bigelow excels in these first thirty minutes is the masterful creation of suspense. The build up of tension is extremely skillful and reaches all the intended intensity or more. I enjoyed that greatly. The device is now only a few minutes from impact - the world is holding its breath. The entire horrific gamut of possible consequences from any foreseeable course of action has been explained to us. We are in the same room with people who are likely not to see the next 48 hours. We see the designated survivors being gathered and bussed to mountain complexes. We watch the moral dilemmas of them and their non-designated colleagues. We This aspect is supremely well done.\n\nBut then, hard stop. The story rewinds, and gets told again from a second perspective.\n\nWe catch a breath of relief, but now the dialogues replay, and honestly the extra level of detail offered from the second perspective is not that valuable. If it is, it's marginally valuable for character development but almost negligible to the plot line. We still don't know if Chicago is going to be incinerated. We implicitly hope that the second retelling will move a bit forward past the firs, but we'll be disappointed - it won't.\n\nInstead, the same thing happens again. Events are told a third time. Now there's almost nothing of value we know about the plot, and the fear that we are going to be left dangling is starting to build up.\n\nThe story gets retold a third time, and then left abandoned in medias res.\n\nWe will never know whether Chicago will be incinerated. We will never know if America will choose to retaliate and how. We will never know the rest of the story. I haven't read reviews yet because I wanted to write my notes with a virgin mind, but I bet many will say \"that's the entire point\". In other words, critics will say it was emphatically the writer's and the director's intent to leave us with a very partial view of the story precisely to signify that, in a nuclear conflict, the Fog of War dominates, and partiality of information is THE dominating factor. In a full-out nuclear conflict, most of us will die without exactly knowing the sequence of events. In fact, not even our political and military leaders might know exactly what happened. It's fair to give the viewer a taste of what that feels like. And I'm ok with that. I'll take it. And still it feels like a lazy excuse for the lazy storyline.\n\nWhat I dislike is the initial, deceiving fast event progression, getting the viewer to 1/3 of the run time with a built up expectations we will see twice more as many events toward a resolution, but then abruptly being denied ANY more events. We will rather be strung along for the remaining two thirds of the movie with no more plot development.\n\nSo, while the overall production quality is high, I find that the story development choices can't, IMHO, but leave the viewer profoundly disappointed. That's why my feeling is that the movie is \"a third\" of a very good movie, repeated three times, rather than a good movie.",

        "selftext": "SPOILERS AHEAD!!!\n\n\nI really enjoyed A House of Dynamite, but I was a bit let down by its ending. It was a solid 8/10 movie, but the ending bumped it down to a 7 for me. (Ignore all the moral posturing on letterboxd though, it’s still pretty good). \n\nThe repetitive structure worked for me tbh, and the cast was excellent across the board, especially Rebecca Ferguson and Jarred Harris. Starting from the hyper-competent experts doing their jobs to perfection, moving up the chain to intelligent bureaucrats, with the final decision on the fate of the world resting on the shoulders of politicians who, although well-meaning, are not really much more than people with good social skills. You lose expertise as you go up the chain of command, but at the same time it doesn’t really matter, as it’s a pure value judgment at the end of the day. It’s clear that the movie is extremely against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the ideology of building up military capacity as a deterrent, so I’m not faulting it on ideological grounds.\n\nThe ending kind of disappointed me though, even though I got what it was going for. It didn’t show the final decision, so leaving the cinema you had to think about what the president as you saw him would do, a guy who was by most standards pretty decent for a politician. Well-meaning, lucid, and kind, but still beholden to public opinion, with no extraordinary skills or intelligence. Which immediately makes you think, “oh shit, if a man like that could potentially make the wrong decision, then if the actual man in charge has to make this decision we’re all fucked.” It doesn’t matter how many skilled experts and bureaucrats you have; the man on top is responsible, and the man we have on top is a malicious clown. So it’s clearly an anti-Trump movie, I thought, even though it’s not explicitly one. Conceptually the ending works for me, but the entertainment-loving casual moviegoer in me was still disappointed that it didn’t actually end with a bang or a big moment, that it was all left hanging in the air.\n\nStill highly recommend the movie, but I’m not too sure on its Oscar chances because it doesn’t really have a bombastic ending to make it as memorable as some of the other contenders this year. It’s a high-wire act for most of its duration, but it doesn’t let you climax imo.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

But there were a couple things that really bothered me about it:\n\n* Everyone automatically assumed that the incoming missile was definitely nuclear and definitely big enough to destory the entirety of Chicago's population. Nuclear weapons come in all shapes and sizes, and based on my reading it seems like warheads on missiles tend to be on the smaller end of the size spectrum for nukes. But that's beside the point because they had absolutely no proof that it was nuclear in the first place, could have been DPRK (or whoever) simply testing their missile delivery system without an actual nuclear warhead onboard. \n\n* There was absolutely no urgency for the president to retaliate immediately. It seemed like for some reason he had to make a retaliation decision before the missile hit Chicago...but why? There were no other projectiles incoming, and they had no idea who had launched, plus my previous point. Nothing would have stopped them from just waiting to see what happened, figuring out who had launched it and then retaliating if necessary. \n\nI appreciate these points were probably done for dramatic effect, but for me it really took away from the story because it made no sense at all. \n\nAnd what about the inconclusive ending? Not that every film has to have a conclusive all loose ends tied up ending, but after all that build up it felt like a bit of a cop out, like the storytellers didn't have the guts to come up with what happened and what the retaliation was. Lots of different ways they could have played it, but this just came off as a bit lazy. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it was still an excellent film, but these points brought it down a few notches for me.",

The actual impact of the missile is never shown.\n\n“I want audiences to leave theaters thinking, ‘OK, what do we do now?’” Bigelow told Tudum. “This is a global issue, and of course I hope against hope that maybe we reduce the nuclear stockpile someday.

I do remember the explanation, that to not do so is to basically surrender, and or commit suicide. And maybe I haven’t been fully educated on the nuances of mutually assured destruction, but how do you select a retaliation target when you still don’t even know who the attacker is?  The movie sidesteps explaining what decision the president makes (brilliantly or sheepishly, depending on your opinion), but the point is pressed, he MUST retaliate and it MUST happen before or as the bomb hits, before we know who fired and before we know if it’s a dud or not. \n\nI’m just a naive Canadian so am I over thinking this?

        "selftext": "Hey everyone my boomer friend and I have a [youtube show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTmNg3gm8Ww) where each week we choose a movie for us to watch. This week he chose 2025's \"A house of Dynamite\" directed by Kathryn Bigelow staring; Idris Elba (POTUS), Rebecca Ferguson (Olivia)and Gabriel Basson (Jake).\n\n**The Good-**\n\nThis movie starts with an interesting premise. An unidentified missile is heading towards Chicago and it follows the national security response to it. The first set of perspecitvies we see are from Olivia who is an officer in the White House situation room and Major Daniel Gonzalez (Anthony Ramos) who is the head of the team charged with stopping the missile mid flight. The tension raises fast and the sense of urgency is done well during this act of the movie. Rebecca Ferguson really shines here as she attempts to manage the White house response all while keeping her team calm. Another performance that stuck out was Idris Elbad as POTUS. WE see his perspective starting the day headed to a girl's basketball camp, and watch his day unfold as the missle is launched and he is tasked with making several tough decisions.\n\n**The Bad-**\n\nWhile the first act really builds tension and sets the stakes I feel the movie starts to fall apart after that. They tell the story from three sets of perspectives which is an interesting way to tell it. Where this movie really fails is we see the same events from new perspectives but we NEVER get any new information. The story telling is reminiscent of \"Weapons\" from earlier this year, but what Weapons did right was each perspective brought new information and slowly moved the timeline forward (and backwards where necessary). Here, we start in the same place and end in the same place, not only that the ending doesn't resolve any of the questions it raised. I don't have a problem when a movie doesn't spoon feed you a button upped ending, however it has to give me something to think about. This ending on the other hand offers us absolutely nothing and doesn't seem to care. It plays out like \"Groundhog's Day\" except it's the audience that is forced to replay the day over again without the option to change anything.\n\n**The Verdict-**\n\nThis is one of those rare times where the Boomer and I agreed, this movie was a waste of an interesting premise and a good team of actors to tell a story with three first acts. 1/5 stars from us both, thanks.",

        "title": "[A House of Dynamite] The US actually has no capability to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike at any point during the movie.",
        "selftext": "In the movie, we learn:\n\n1. An ICBM is launched from the Pacific.\n2. There are no other ICBMs, just a single launch.\n3. The launch wasn't picked up by early-warning satellites.\n4. No group is claiming the launch as theirs.\n5. Chicago is the target of the ICBM.\n6. There are no [MIRVs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_independently_targetable_reentry_vehicle), just a single warhead.\n7. There are no apparent decoys ([penaids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_aid)).\n\nHere are some possible scenarios and their likelihood based on what we know from above:\n\n* **Nuclear first strike – Extremely unlikely.** This is like if Russia or China was trying to destroy the US before it could retaliate. In this scenario, they would launch dozens if not hundreds of ICBMs and all of them would have MIRVs. The launch would also have been detected by the early-warning satellites.\n\n* **Rogue submarine captain – Extremely unlikely.** Same as above, a rogue captain would launch multiple ICBMs with MIRVs that would get picked up by early-warning satellites and he probably wouldn't target Chicago.\n\n* **Accidental launch – Very unlikely.** This could explain the single ICBM but not the lack of MIRVs or the failure of the early-warning satellites, plus Chicago seems like a really random place to accidentally nuke. Also, an accidental launch would probably be followed promptly by the country that launched it reaching out to avoid WWIII. I could believe that it would make sense to keep quiet after an accidental launch but this scenario seems unlikely, mostly due to lack of MIRVs. North Korea might not have MIRVs but they're barely able to launch on purpose, so accidental launch (especially targeting a specific inland city) seems extremely unlikely for them.\n\n* **AI-initiated launch – Very unlikely.** Very similar to accidental launch above. Same issues where lack of MIRVs, only a single launch, and targeting Chicago don't make sense. Lack of MIRVs means North Korea but I doubt that they would have AI and that it would launch an attack like what's shown in the movie. This is hard to fully eliminate because AI is a black box that could do anything for no reason but I think it's pretty unlikely.\n\n* **North Korean launch – Very unlikely.** This checks a lot of the boxes and seems like what the movie wants us to think but it doesn't make much sense. The movie tells us that a North Korean sea-launch is feasible and that would explain the single ICBM, since they might only have one fully functioning ICBM to begin with. But after that, this theory falls apart. North Korea would also have no way to avoid early-warning satellite detection and China wouldn't assist in a plot that could end in nuclear armageddon. North Korea also wouldn't target Chicago when it would be much easier to hit Honolulu, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, or Seattle. One of those cities would also give far less warning time. Most importantly, North Korea [isn't stupid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEoZLGHKvy8) and wouldn't risk nuclear annihilation in this way.\n\nSo all scenarios are unlikely? Where does that leave us? Well that's where I'd like to propose my own theory about what was really happening and who was behind the attacks. The crux of this theory is that a single ICBM launch is an extremely unlikely scenario to begin with. Launching a nuke is a highly destabilizing event and it's why none have occurred in the nearly 80 years since it has been possible. You can read more about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/1o57bb1/official_discussion_thread_a_house_of_dynamite/nkfhbp3/), but suffice to say, there has never been a tactical nuclear detonation (only strategic) and that momentum has been a tremendously stabilizing force in the world. Nukes are a genie in a bottle and the scenario in this movie where a lone ICBM comes out of the blue is extremely unlikely. Any nuclear attack is extremely unlikely to begin with but it's next-level bizarre for a single ICBM to be used. It should be expected that the explanation for such a scenario would be equally bizarre. With that in mind, consider the following scenario:\n\n* **My theory of what's really happening in the movie –** As explored and explained above, there are no non-desperate non-suicidal scenarios where the attack in the movie makes sense, assuming the US has retaliatory capabilities. Given that the suicidal and desperate explanations seem to also make minimal sense, the only plausible scenario is that the US actually doesn't have retaliatory capabilities throughout the course of the film. That may seem extreme but it's no more extreme than a lone ICBM coming out of nowhere. As hinted at in the film when they discuss their systems possibly being compromised, I believe that's what is actually happening. I think an adversarial nation has infiltrated and compromised US computers systems, communications, and US Strategic Command as a whole. This could be AI-assisted hacking or just traditional cyber warfare. The country most likely to be capable of this would be China, since they manufacture so much that relates to computers and are probably the biggest threat to the US in terms of military and superpower status by a good margin. The way that the attack in the movie works from China's perspective is that they launched one nuke at Chicago to test response time, intercept abilities, and to gather data in general. It's not a problem if the US shoots it down because there's more to come. The intercept failure could also be explained by China sabotaging it. It doesn't matter though because China is just listening in to the US reaction with their finger on the button to fully disable US retaliatory strike capabilities at the drop of a hat. Regardless of how many launches it takes, China's plan is to ultimately deliver a clear message that no US city is safe from their nuclear strikes. It's possible that it's a dummy warhead or there is no ICBM at all (China is possibly tricking the systems and sensors WarGames style) but it doesn't matter because the point is to demonstrate that they could nuke Chicago and for the US to realize that they have no retaliatory capabilities. For this purpose, Chicago is a good choice because it's a huge population that demonstrates the ability to hit any city while not actually disrupting US chain of command for when it comes time to negotiate. As mentioned in the movie, there really isn't even much of a military presence in Chicago. The scenario I'm describing here would play out like Japan in WWII. Chicago would be destroyed (or its destruction would be simulated to show that it could be destroyed), the US would attempt to retaliate, and they'd find that they're unable to do so. If the US decided not to retaliate then China could optionally back down after having learned a lot about STRATCOM and possibly destroying Chicago. More likely, though, China would be all-in at that point and simply launch another ICBM until the US attempted to retaliate and realized that they couldn't. Similar to Japan, China would then threaten to nuke major US cities until the US agreed to unconditional surrendered, at which point China would get considerable concessions. The US would not be destroyed, it would continue to exist much like Japan did but under Chinese influence. This scenario explains why Chicago was chosen, why it involved a single ICBM with a single warhead, and why early-warning satellites failed. China is basically just toying with the US and trying to learn as much as possible before revealing their incredible leverage. In this scenario, it would be likely that Russia would be aligned with China. China, Russia, and US stockpiles account for roughly [90% of the world's nuclear stockpile](https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/8301.jpeg). France and the UK would still have nukes but it would only be a small fraction of the number controlled by China and Russia. That would mean that mutually assured destruction ([MAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction)) would no longer be applicable and all of NATO would effectively be forced to give in to China's demands or at least not intervene. It seems like it would still be a dicey situation but it could definitely be worth it for China because it would mean becoming the sole world superpower in a matter of hours. Other countries would lack a non-suicidal option once the US was compromised, plus China would likely survive even if other countries decided to act. This imbalance of nuclear power is not unprecedented. I'm struggling to find a source and will update if I find it but I believe there was a brief window where US ICBMs were unable to survive reentry heating and only the Soviet Union knew about it. I think the most likely scenario in this movie is cyber warfare but there are lots of ways that such an imbalance (or \"gap\" in Dr. Strangelove parlance) could occur in a way that would allow one side to take control. Another example would be if the US president was a sleeper agent. That doesn't seem to be the case in this movie but it would effectively make the US unable to launch a retaliatory strike. Doctrine is pretty clear that the President makes the decisions regarding nuclear strikes and that fact is pointed out in the movie when SECDEF tries to take unilateral action. Even after multiple US cities have been nuked, it could be argued that retaliation would end the world and thus no retaliation would be authorized. Refusal to retaliate would arouse no suspicion of a sleeper President because it's an unprecedented situation that's entirely the President's call and it's easy to make the case that no action should be taken, just as Jake did in the movie. My point is that there are plenty of plausible ways in which a nation like China could pour resources into a secret project capable of rendering the US nuclear stockpile suddenly and unexpectedly unusable. All this is to say that MAD it's a delicate balance that has created relative peace and stability for decades but any imbalance could be taken advantage of to radically reshape the geopolitical landscape in a matter of hours or days. In the case of this movie, I think that China is doing to the US what the US did to Japan at the end of WWII. It's the only scenario that makes sense with the facts given in the movie.\n\nThe one caveat to this theory is that I think the filmmakers just did what was useful for the plot. I'm not sure why they picked Chicago but I do think that's why there was only one ICBM. A single missile makes it easier for the audience to follow along in a movie that's already chock-full of technical jargon. At least within the movie, it seems like the reason for the attack and the outcome is meant to be ambiguous, but who knows if the filmmakers had a realistic scenario in mind that was the basis of the plot. I hope they did because it's kind of silly to create a high-realism movie but to base it on an unrealistic premise. We may never know. For what it's worth, though, this post is my headcanon. For anyone interested in learning more, here's an incredibly interesting three-part blogpost about MAD: https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2016/11/18/the-president-and-the-bomb/\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR –** The only scenario that makes sense is that an adversarial nation (likely China) has infiltrated and compromised US Strategic Command and that the US actually has no capability to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike at any point during the movie.\n\n---\n\n**Edit –** Here's [How Real is \"A House of Dynamite\"?](https://castro.fm/episode/uIMsdT) from the SpyTalk podcast where Former White House Situation Room Director Larry Pfeiffer discusses the realism of the movie. Around 22 minutes, the hosts seem to agree that the message of the movie is to point out the inadequacy of US intercept capabilities. I worry that many people will come away from this movie thinking that the US should have the capability to intercept as much as possible. For starters, it's not possible to intercept at a rate anywhere close to an adversary's ability to launch. It's not feasible to produce interceptors for a lower cost than the thing that they're intercepting and certainly not feasible to reliably stop all incoming nukes in the event of a first strike, especially when considering MIRVs and penaids. Even more fundamentally, though, doing so would be counterproductive. The relative stability of the last 80 years is due to a shared belief that mutually assured destruction would actually occur in practice. Countries don't use nukes because they believe it would result in getting nuked right back and ultimately result in the end of civilization. If you take away MAD by creating new technologies that allows one or both sides to intercept nukes then nukes become palatable, since the threat of an unmitigated nuclear apocalypse would be abated. The capability to reliably intercept entire nuclear salvos would make the situation similar to if we didn't have nukes at all, meaning countries could invade each other as they did before the advent of nukes. This [comic](https://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;id=1852) illustrates the point. The hosts keep pushing the question about interceptors and Larry gives a good answer at the 42 minute mark. He explains that interceptors are mostly for rogue nations, i.e. interceptors basically move the goalposts so that countries with only a couple nukes are more like countries without any nukes, since their launches could be entirely neutralized. Interceptors don't destabilize (at least not significantly) so long as they remain ineffective against full nuclear salvos. There's still an argument that any interceptor capability makes nuclear warning shots more acceptable but those are still deterred by mutually assured destruction and [launch on warning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_on_warning).",

        "selftext": "By Kayvan Kaboli\n\nThe story begins with a missile carrying a nuclear warhead traveling over the Pacific Ocean toward the United States. A House of Dynamite is a portrayal of dread, displaying anxiety in every second of the film, a narrative that is repeated three times throughout the movie, each from a different perspective.\n\nThe first telling comes from the viewpoint of lower-ranking officers whose mission under such circumstances is to shoot down the missile mid-air. The same thrilling account is then retold from the perspective of high-ranking officers and the Secretary of Defense, and finally from the vantage point of the President, the ultimate decision-maker in issuing a retaliatory order to destroy whoever has committed such madness, a culprit that remains unknown throughout the film.\n\nIn critiques and analyses of this movie, much has been said about technical aspects and real-world military conditions. But what most of these reviews overlook are the two words uttered in the third retelling of the story, when the camera follows the President and the officer carrying the nuclear football as they enter the launch codes into the device: suicide or surrender.\n\nThe film’s message clearly suggests that it does not matter which side has the upper hand in nuclear military capability or whose arsenal is more heavily stocked with missiles and warheads. Ultimately—when the situation has moved beyond deterrence and missiles are already in the air—there will be no winners; all sides will lose. In other words, the decision becomes one between suicide and surrender.",

        "selftext": "This movie was shocking to me, both in how bad it is, and in that it seems like it was made solely as propaganda against the United States government and military. I was surprised by this, as Katheryn Bigelow directed Zero Dark Thirty, a very entertaining movie and one of the most dishonest pro-military pieces of propaganda in the history of cinema. The thesis of Zero Dark Thirty is that torture works and that's how we got Bin Laden (which is bullshit bc torture usually gets you little to no actionable intel), and the thesis of House of Dynamite is if someone fires a nuclear missile at the U.S. everyone will panic and then Chicago will explode. I am critical of the U.S. government and its military, but they wage war and prepare to wage war for a living. In House of Dynamite every character responding to this incoming missile attack seems to be working their first day in military or government and is terrified by it. It's roughly two hours of \"there is a missile coming. We can't stop it so I should panic and prepare for us all to die.\"   \n  \nIf you study international affairs, specifically the Cold War, you quickly run into a concept called mutually assured destruction. It wouldn't make a great movie, but if someone fired a nuclear missile at the United States we would quickly identify the attacker and obliterate that country, and the ensuing exchange of nuclear weapons between the attacking nation and their allies and our allies would end human life as we know it. We have a bunker out west with enough nuclear weapons to explode the rock of the earth over 15 times. This whole movie it's just \"Chicago is going to be nuked, we can't stop it or figure out who is responsible, guess we are fucked.\" The tension builds slowly to nothing, the movie ends before the impact of the missile on Chicago. It's two hours of people freaking out and not being able to make a decision, then nothing. Just a fuckin garbage movie. So much acting talent to tell a ridiculous story that goes nowhere, a waste of both the actors' time and the viewers.",

I only heard about Jacobsen's book because, in April 2024, Legendary Pictures announced they were adapting it with Denis Villeneuve at the helm. I read it last summer, and it's terrifying...and I would bet cash there's no way the writer of A House of Dynamite hasn't read it. There are too many coincidences, from the premise to the tone to the structure with the ensemble of characters.\n\nSo, what gives? Is this a DANTE'S PEAK/VOLCANO situation?

That North Korea sucks? That USA has an 18 minute turnaround from launch detection to retaliation? They made it seem like the world is one AI hallucination away from needing the *publicly elected* chief in command to maintain the Nothing Ever Happens era. \n\nThe film made the Russians seem cooperative and innocent, albeit oppositional in the BOOMEREST, cold-warest kind of way. It was even included that some oligarchs’ yachts had been seized (by allies per the Ukraine war) and that was considered as a reason why they might stupidly launch a missile, even though they’re famously not stupid like that. On top, there was little to no Chinese commentary which I THOUGHT WAS RATHER STRANGE. The Pyongyang rhetoric was thick with libbrain, so much that it seemed far fetched and *reaching*. The so called DPRK expert only had to say that they had some tech and were trying out new tech, and could not be trusted in reporting their new, tried-out tech.\n\nMy personal take is that this whole thing was a thinly veiled “oh jeeze” event-situation with China front and slightly off-centre, even though the film gesticulated furiously that the DPRK were the launch culprits. I think the silence of Mandarin and Chinese politik was deafening. Is this what propaganda looks like now?

This is how America should react in a scenario if it was perfect, it does take liberities such as the attack itself, the interceptors failing, being unable to contact other nuclear armed nations, president incapcitated etc.\n\nFrom a laymans POV on nuclear war/operations/proccesses which i clearely i am an idiot in i would say Annie's book would be quite accurate in regards to the timings and information she presents on various systems which are in place. I of course expect somethings to be hidden in the research or kept away from the public but it roughly is correct at the time the information was gathered and from interviews she pulled it from.\n\nNow if you have read the book the basic plotline of the film has just been ripped from it with a few details left out or changed and more characters added with a human element. It focuses on a few of the main processes but splices it with human behaviour and actions.\n\nFrankly ACT 1 was fucking great to a point, but ACT 2 and 3 were completely not needed and frankly ruined the entire movie, it if was a 30 to 50min film it would have been dead good because it built up the suspense quite well (think of Homeland season 1, last episode).\n\nThe ICBM not being detected until flight was horseshit but i think they picked this option so they didnt have to name a country in this political climate so that made the timeline shorter.\n\nChicago being the target, it is a population centre with no high level infrastructure, it is more of a terrorist attack at this point.\n\nInterceptor missiles failing, sending 2 incase more nukes arrive okay but send out 5 and its success rate varies and increases overall.\n\nVarious characters taking 5min phonecalls etc, i know it is the human element but frankly they wouldnt have time for it in my opinion.\n\nSec def committing suicide was random as fuck since most likely he would be man handled into the chopper, as would many other high ranking personnel and be moved to secure locations.\n\nLaunching a full on response to 1 nuke basically obliterating the world seemed daft, it was only chicago, it was not at any key infrastructure militiary or civilian and you have the option of investigating afterwards which i think any sane person would choose to do at that time.\n\nACT 2 and 3 were really not needed at all, we had heard it all before and it was just filler, the only part which would have been good to keep in was the president having to wrestle with the choice of launching or not which could have been spliced into ACT 1.\n\nNo outcome at the end of the film either, do not know if it landed and detonated or malfunctioned and failed.\n\nFor a political thriller watch Sum of all Fears as that goes through a scenario like this in the final act\n\nMaybe it was just me but i expected it to be better than what it was, the director aint no slouch but you could have cut and spliced from ACTs 2 and 3 into ACT 1 as to when certains things were happening at the time. Using splitscreens and timers and making it feel that you are on the call or in the room and how long is left till impact.\n\nMaybe i am just warped from Annie's book and automatically biased towards a version like that which i tbh i think i am, i like facts and figures not wishy washy emotion crap, i need the tension and realism that it portrayed in ACT 1.\n\n8/10 for ACT 1, 3/10 overall.",

You train for the most extreme scenario imaginable, but your actual job is to wait.\n\nIt’s like being on the world’s most stressful standby mode.
