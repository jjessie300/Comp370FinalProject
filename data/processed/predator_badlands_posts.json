        "self_text": "\nIt tries to reinvent the franchise with a sensitive young Predator as the hero and an android sidekick preaching about feelings. Instead of suspense or brutality we get a PG13 space adventure that feels more like a Saturday morning cartoon than a Predator movie.\n\nThe tone is all over the place. One minute it wants to be emotional and deep, the next minute there is a cute alien pet tagging along like it is Disney merchandise. The Predator is no longer a terrifying hunter. He is basically a misunderstood teenager with trust issues. They stripped away everything that made these creatures menacing and turned them into moral lesson delivery devices.\n\nThe writing is painfully predictable and full of cheesy moments. There is actually a scene where the android gives the Predator a motivational speech about being himself while soft music plays. It feels like Lion King but worse. The villain is just an angry Predator dad yelling about honor and bloodlines. No complexity, no subtlety, just noise. The big monster they build up the whole film is killed offscreen by someone else which completely ruins the payoff.\n\nEven the action is boring. Everything is buried under CGI and loud music with zero tension. No grit, no horror, no atmosphere. It is all colorful effects and nothing sticks. It feels weightless. You never feel any danger because the film is too scared to show anything intense.\n\nIn the end Predator Badlands tries to be bold but ends up being toothless. It wants to be emotional, epic and family friendly all at once and fails at everything. Instead of a hunt we get a lecture. Instead of fear we get feelings. The Predator did not evolve here. It got domesticated.\n",

        "self_text": "*Cast out from its clan, an alien hunter and an unlikely ally embark on a treacherous journey in search of the ultimate adversary.*\n\nDirector: Dan Trachtenberg\n\nCast: Elle Fanning, Dimitrius Koloamatangi\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [89%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/predator_badlands)\n\n**Metacritic:** [69 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/predator-badlands/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[NextBestPicture - Giovanni Lago](https://nextbestpicture.com/predator-badlands/) \\- 6 / 10\n\n&gt;Trachtenberg's approach this time around gradually builds to a more underwhelming outing, even if his vision finds itself at its most grand. Not every set piece is effective despite some wonderful below-the-line work to help elevate the experience. The inevitable steering towards a more franchise-heavy focus is all but worrisome.\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/04/predator-badlands-review-elle-fanning) \\- 2 / 5\n\n&gt;The sheer pointlessness of everything that happens subtracts the oxygen and even Fanning\u2019s imperishable star quality can\u2019t save it.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Richard Lawson](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/predator-badlands-review-elle-fanning-dan-trachtenberg-1236417477/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s a perspective shift that mostly works, so thoughtful is the film\u2019s construction. Trachtenberg is generous but also careful with detail; his film remembers what it has previously introduced us to, satisfyingly referencing back to plants and animals passingly encountered an hour prior. *Badlands* is a decidedly B-movie that thoroughly utilizes and enjoys the freedoms allowed when any prestige ambition is eschewed. The film simply wants to be the best version of a zillionth *Predator* installment that it can be. If it has to complicate \u2014 and, yes, soften \u2014 the branding to do that, so be it.\u00a0\n\n[David Ehrlich - IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/predator-badlands-movie-review-1235158691/) \\- 'B+'\n\n&gt;The least \u201cPredator\u201d-like moments in this standalone sequel are rooted in Trachtenberg\u2019s love for the property, and all help \u201cBadlands\u201d to make a uniquely compelling argument that \u201cPredator\u201d deserves to be higher on the Hollywood food chain than anyone thought to place it over the last 40 years. By reckoning with the series\u2019 fundamental weakness rather than continuing to pretend that it\u2019s the series\u2019 greatest strength, Trachtenberg has made the brand richer than ever before. No, this isn\u2019t your daddy\u2019s \u201cPredator,\u201d and it *definitely* isn\u2019t *Dek\u2019s* daddy\u2019s \u201cPredator,\u201d but as a wise synthetic once said, \u201cWe can be more than what they ask of us.\u201d How rare \u2014 and extremely refreshing \u2014\u00a0to see a big studio movie recognize that the same can be true of itself.\u00a0\n\n[IGN - Clint Gage](https://www.ign.com/articles/predator-badlands-review) \\- 8 / 10\n\n&gt;Dan Trachtenberg is heading in an interesting direction with this franchise and he gets bonus points for that. The Predator as a mysterious murder monster is getting some of his backstory filled in, and that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. Badlands, in shifting the perspective to a Yautja main character, actually highlights what\u2019s been great about this franchise in its better moments. Dek and Thia are an unexpectedly fun pairing that bring a new energy to the franchise and an altogether different kind of hunt. It might not be pulling the skull and spine out of us and screaming in bloody victory, but it gets close.\n\n[DEADLINE - Damon Wise](https://deadline.com/2025/11/predator-badlands-review-elle-fanning-dimitrius-schuster-koloamatangi-1236606321/)\n\n&gt;Returning director Dan Trachtenberg is clearly in a groove here, and his enthusiasm helps, notably in the film\u2019s impeccable world-building. But the action scenes never seem to galvanize, and somewhere along the line the predator, once a ruthless, unstoppable killing machine, has simply lost its menacing mojo. It all seems a bit, well, *silly* \u2014 like a long episode of *Succession* starring John Travolta\u2019s character in *Battlefield Earth*, or the adventures of Eric Trump in space \u2014 and that surely can\u2019t bode well for the inevitable next instalment.\n\n[Slash Film - Jeremy Mathai](https://www.slashfilm.com/2016872/predator-badlands-movie-review/) \\- 8 / 10\n\n&gt;If there are any negatives to point out, they're mostly a byproduct of blockbuster issues as a whole. The brisk pacing that keeps things moving at a breezy clip also means any semblance of character depth and nuance is either left as subtext or outright explained in exposition, though Trachtenberg still manages to find quiet grace notes for both Dek and Thia (and perhaps others too spoilery to give away here) amid all the carnage. And even as the action rivals anything in the franchise, the much larger sense of scale might have some yearning for the contained, stripped-down joys of \"Prey.\" All of those nitpicks pale in comparison to what the filmmakers accomplish here, however. By far the funniest, most heartfelt, and boldest \"Predator\" movie of them all, \"Badlands\" etches its place in franchise history \u2014 right alongside the classic that started it all and the three worthy follow-ups that\u00a0Trachtenberg has delivered so far. Let's hope there are many more to come.\n\n",

The whole premise of the Predator being a runt and running off to prove himself is fine, I can get behind that to some degree.\n\nThe issue comes with the fact they try to be emotional with it, predators aren\u2019t supposed to be like that are they, it feels wrong from the older movies.  Also the ending with the older predator???  He\u2019s meant to be the strongest and the leader and yet he gets packed up by his runt son who\u2019s been hunting for like 2 weeks??  \n\njust doesn\u2019t make sense to me, i feel like it\u2019s a kids movie rather than a predator movie.  The beauty of predator to me was the Gore and suspense and ruthless efficiency.  I just feel like this new movie lacks that and we aren\u2019t gonna get anymore of those. ",

It\u2019s legitimately the most smartly made film in the franchise yet. It takes a pop culture icon and delivers something entirely fresh never put on theater screens before. \n\nIt almost reminds me of Matt Reeves\u2019s swing at the Planet of the Apes franchise in 2014. The main character is not a human. He does not speak English. But somehow the filmmakers tell a genuinely good story that is relatable to the human in us. \n\nBeing a Star Wars fan who has been routinely let down, Predator Badlands is a rare example of a major science fiction franchise with FILMMAKERS THAT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING.\n\nAs far as where I\u2019d rank it among other 2025 films, I think it\u2019s better than Mission Impossible, Fantastic Four, Superman, and even F1. \n\nAlso for you Alien franchise lovers, a certain company plays a **substantial** role in the film. \n\n\ud83d\udc40",

Badlands\u2019 budget is around 100 million less than Ares\u2019 and it still has fantastic VFX, visuals, a great story from what I\u2019ve heard, and not mention a similar runtime. \n\nWhether we want to admit it or not, Leto didn\u2019t help with the box office. He was awesome in the movie, but he just can\u2019t be the lead if we want these movies to garner more success. I\u2019m not saying he can\u2019t be involved in a future TRON film.. he just can\u2019t be plastered everywhere, because that turned a lot of people off unfortunately, a lot more than I imagined. I hear a lot about displeasure towards Disney these days but Predator IP seems to be doing absolutely fine. \n\nTRON\u2019s fourth movie undoubtedly needs a new approach. I\u2019d love the current story in TRON to be completed within the next few so we can get from this franchise.. and I think Disney may need to take an out of Predator: Badlands book.",

I'll be back later today (Tuesday 11/18) at 3 PM ET to answer questions.\n\n\\------\n\nEDIT (10pm PST)\n\nThanks for all your questions! That's it for tonight, but I might have some time in the morning to answer a few more.\n\n\\- Sarah",

        "self_text": "This was the funniest explanation, but here are other serious ones so nobody calls me a filthy casual:\n\n1: The trophies could be inherited/gifted/stolen from other Yautja, as the race itself is likely far older than the Dinosaurs, and they do pass trophies on to worthy opponents as seen in Predator 2 (1990).\n\n2: The tribe in Predators (2010) had their own planet set up specifically as a game preserve, so it\u2019s entirely possible the Yautja abducted prehistoric species from earth and set them loose on other game preserve planets, allowing them to survive earth\u2019s several extinction events.\n\n3: The Warlord Predator in Predator: Killer of Killers (2025) keeps any creatures who have killed other Yautja in cryosleep, as they are prized opponents, and can unfreeze them after thousands of years for gladitorial combat. Even if the specific motivation to put a dinosaur in cryosleep doesn\u2019t exist in the Yautja\u2019s culture, the technology does.\n\n4: Weylend Yutanni managed to print whole facehuggers from a single Xenomorph in Alien: Romulus (2024) and the United Systems Military managed to entirely recreate Ellen Ripley and a queen facehugger from mere blood samples in Alien: Resurrection (1997). It\u2019s not impossible that a company in the Alien+Predator universe managed to bring dinosaurs back Jurassic Park style, no extraterrestrial assistance required. \n\n5: They can pull a Monsterverse and retcon that obvious skull into a stupid bullshit ai generated monster whose skull just so happens to perfectly resemble an Earth dinosaur. Did you know the giant Triceratops-like skull in Kong: Skull Island was actually from a giant pinecone? This was the real shitty detail all along.\n",

        "self_text": "A lot of the criticism about Dek, particularly his hair or \u201cdreadlock\u201d placement, feels like an overreaction from an exhausting part of the fandom. While everyone is entitled to their own personal tastes, some of the complaints are frankly whiney and miss the bigger picture.\n\nOne mockup I saw on here did a great job illustrating how a Yautja\u2019s cranial structure and deadlocks might logically develop over time. Considering that Yautja are long-lived with some sources even saying thousands of years, it\u2019s reasonable to think that their physiology would continue to change over such massive spans of time. Gradual, distinguishable shifts, like deadlocks being pushed further toward the back of the skull to accommodate a growing cranial crest, make perfect biological sense to me.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a wild departure that \u201cruins\u201d the lore or undermines the IP, it\u2019s a naturalistic development that I think still respects the creature\u2019s biology and history. Variation within a species, especially among age groups, is not just realistic but it actually adds more depth to the world building.\n\nIt\u2019s especially silly to blame Disney for this change when Prey, released under Disney\u2019s ownership, was widely praised and respected the spirit of the Predator franchise far better than The Predator (2018) did. Badlands looks like it\u2019s taking some creative risks while still honoring the core elements that make the Yautja iconic and I think that should be celebrated, not knee-jerk rejected because of a slight shift in hairline placement.\n\nI think Dek looks fine. I\u2019m not claiming his design is perfect or that everyone needs to love it. I\u2019m simply saying that it fits, it makes sense, and it\u2019s nowhere near the catastrophe some people are making it out to be.",

And not just any screwball comedy, either; \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d is \u201cIt Happened One Night\u201d with a Predator monster. **3.5/4**\n\nKyle Smith, Wall Street Journal - All in good fun for a B-movie, and \u201cP: B\u201d does not pretend to be anything else.\n\nBob Strauss, San Francisco Chronicle - Inhuman though it may be, this is far-and-away the most humane of \u201cPredators,\u201d expanding rather than skimping on the series\u2019 blood hunt fundamentals. **4/4**\n\nAdam Nayman, Toronto Star - All of this is reasonably absorbing, with Trachtenberg once again proving a spirited -- if conventional -- purveyor of B-movie tropes and thrills, albeit in a slightly anodyne register. **2.5/4**\n\nTrevor Lenzmeier, Seattle Times - Ultimately, \u201cBadlands\u201d is a fun weekend watch for your home theater \u2014 but it won\u2019t leave a lasting impression. **2/4**\n\nManohla Dargis, New York Times - In classic genre fashion, the filmmakers here are refreshing the franchise with both new ideas and elements from older installments and other touchstones.\n\nRichard Whittaker, Austin Chronicle - Schuster-Koloamatangi plays Dek with a certain pompous exasperation that, even under layers of latex and CG, is undeniably and deliberately hilarious. If it bleeds, you can laugh at it. **3.5/5**\n\nJake Wilson, Sydney Morning Herald - A Predator who learns to care: it seems like a bit much. Still, Dek softens only to a point \u2013 and the moral message of the climax is as jumbled than everything else... **2.5/5**\n\nTim Robey, Daily Telegraph (UK) - The energy, gruesome thrills and craziness of this flick are hard not to admire. **4/5**\n\nLiz Shannon Miller, Consequence - Badlands flips the approach and finds something fresh and wonderful and bold as a result \u2014 as if James Cameron had made Terminator 2 entirely from the T-800\u2019s point of view. **A-**\n\nJustin Clark, Slant Magazine - The action is horrifying, inventive, and heart-pounding, but it\u2019s also the least surprising part of Predator: Badlands. **3/4**\n\nMatt Zoller Seitz, [RogerEbert.com](http://RogerEbert.com) \\- The takeaway, I think, is applicable to beings all across the universe: sometimes the things you want most are not worth wanting, and until you figure that out, you\u2019ll never be free. **4/4**\n\nPerri Nemiroff, Perri Nemiroff (YouTube) - I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get over the fact that we have a Predator film that\u2019s essentially an alien and robot buddy movie. It\u2019s so refreshing to see a film franchise dish out something so unexpected. **4.5/5**\n\nOlly Richards, Time Out - It cleverly pulls at the supposed laws of the series in a way that makes it more interesting without diluting the fearsome nature of the title character. Trachtenberg is making the franchise richer with every instalment. **4/5**\n\nNick De Semlyen, Empire Magazine - Badlands is big popcorn fun, a geeky commingling of lurid sci-fi, comedy and rowdy action that gets high off its own supply. **4/5**\n\nJarrod Jones, AV Club - The mystique of the Predator, what it was and where it came from, was best left to the imagination; the second you start pulling at that thread, the whole idea falls apart. **C**\n\nTim Grierson, Screen International - Reconceiving the iconic sci-fi villain as an underdog hero, Predator: Badlands is a consistently entertaining action-thriller filled with propulsive set pieces.\n\nMark Kennedy, Associated Press - It\u2019s hard to underestimate Fanning here, who keeps us interested. She doesn\u2019t just add comic relief, she adds a much-needed human element. **2.5/4**\n\nMeagan Navarro, Bloody Disgusting - The Predator franchise takes a sharp detour into adventure, with its propulsive, creature-filled action matching the polarizing thrills of Yautja innovation. **3.5/5**\n\nAlonso Duralde, The Film Verdict - Between the wise-cracking sidekick, the adorable non-verbal pet, and the protagonist who undergoes personal growth, Predator: Badlands often resembles the pilot of a vintage Saturday-morning cartoon \u2014 but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nLinda Marric, HeyUGuys - Bold, bizarre, and unexpectedly moving, it\u2019s the kind of risk-taking sci-fi we don\u2019t see enough of nowadays. **4/5**\n\nPeter Debruge, Variety - The strongest film with \u201cPredator\u201d in the title since the 1987 original (Trachtenberg\u2019s earlier \u201cPrey\u201d notwithstanding).\n\nDavid Ehrlich, IndieWire - By reckoning with the series\u2019 fundamental weakness rather than continuing to pretend that it\u2019s the series\u2019 greatest strength, Trachtenberg has made the brand richer than ever before. **B+**\n\nBarry Hertz, Globe and Mail - A sometimes inventive but too frequently anemic effort to expand the proudly R-rated Predator-verse into the mass-market appeal of PG sterility.\n\nDavid Fear, Rolling Stone - It\u2019s really a comedic road movie at heart, with as much yuks over a mismatched pair trying to get along as yucks involving the goopy innards of cosmic mastodons.\n\nWilliam Bibbiani, TheWrap - Like 'Prey' before it, 'Predator: Badlands' is mainstream sci-fi filmmaking at its zenith, and it\u2019s proof \u2014 in an era where proof is hard to find \u2014 that big, expensive action spectacles don\u2019t have to suck.\n\nRichard Lawson, The Hollywood Reporter - The film simply wants to be the best version of a zillionth Predator installment that it can be. If it has to complicate -- and, yes, soften -- the branding to do that, so be it.\n\nNick Schager, The Daily Beast - The series\u2019 second-best installment and a rousing start to what appears to be a grand new franchise future.\n\nPeter Bradshaw, Guardian - The sheer pointlessness of everything that happens subtracts the oxygen and even Fanning\u2019s imperishable star quality can\u2019t save it. **2/5**\n\n**SYNOPSIS:**\n\n\u201cPredator: Badlands,\u201d which stars Elle Fanning and Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi, is set in the future on a remote planet, where a young Predator (Schuster-Koloamatangi), outcast from his clan, finds an unlikely ally in Thia (Fanning) and embarks on a treacherous journey in search of the ultimate adversary.\n\n**CAST:**\n\n* Elle Fanning as Thia / Tessa\n* Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi as Dek / Njohrr\n\n**DIRECTED BY:** Dan Trachtenberg\n\n**SCREENPLAY BY:** Patrick Aison, Brian Duffield\n\n**STORY BY:** Dan Trachtenberg, Patrick Aison\n\n**BASED ON CHARACTERS CREATED BY:** Jim Thomas, John Thomas\n\n**PRODUCED BY:** John Davis, Dan Trachtenberg, Marc Toberoff, Ben Rosenblatt, Brent O\u2019Connor\n\n**EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:** Lawrence Gordon, James E.
